<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>With apologies to Dame History for having taken liberties
with some of her famous characters, I would ask the Reader to
remember that this story is fiction and not history.</p>

<p>I have made use of some of the most romantic episodes in the
life of Robert Burns, such as his courtship of Mary Campbell and
his love affair with Jean Armour, “the Belle of Mauchline,” and
many of the historical references and details are authentic.</p>

<p>But my chief purpose in using these incidents was to make
“Highland Mary” as picturesque, lovable and interesting a character
in Fiction as she has always been in the History of Scotland.</p>

<h1>HIGHLAND MARY</h1>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>In the “but” or living-room (as it was termed in
Scotland) of a little whitewashed thatched cottage
near Auld Ayr in the land of the Doon, sat a quiet,
sedate trio of persons consisting of two men and a
woman. She who sat at the wheel busily engaged in
spinning was the mistress of the cot, a matronly,
middle-aged woman in peasant’s cap and ’kerchief.</p>

<p>The other two occupants of the room for years
had been inseparable companions and cronies, and
when not at the village inn could be found sitting
by the fireside of one of their neighbors, smoking
their pipes in blissful laziness. And all Ayrshire
tolerated and even welcomed Tam O’Shanter and his
cronie, “Souter Johnny.”</p>

<p>Tam was an Ayrshire farmer, considered fairly
well-to-do in the neighborhood, while Souter (shoemaker)
Johnny was the village cobbler, who seldom,
if ever, worked at his trade nowadays. All the
afternoon had they sat by the open fireplace, with its
roomy, projecting chimney, watching the peat burn,
seldom speaking, smoking their old smelly pipes, and
sighing contentedly as the warmth penetrated their
old bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burns glanced at her uninvited guests occasionally
with no approving eye. If they must inflict
their presence on her, why couldn’t they talk, say
something, tell her some of the news, the gossip of
the village? she thought angrily; their everlasting
silence had grown very monotonous to the good
dame. She wished they would go. It was nearing
supper time, and Gilbert would soon be in from the
field, and she knew that he did not approve of the
two old cronies hanging around monopolizing the
fireplace to the exclusion of everyone else, and she did
not want any hard words between them and Gilbert.
Suddenly with a final whirl she fastened the end of
the yarn she was spinning, and getting up from
her seat set the wheel back against the whitewashed
wall.</p>

<p>Then going to the old deal dresser, she took from
one of the drawers a white cloth and spread it
smoothly over the table, then from the rack, which
hung above it, she took the old blue dishes and quickly
set the table for their evening meal. At these preparations
for supper the old cronies looked eagerly
expectant, for none knew better than they the excellence
of the Widow Burns’ cooking, and a look of
pleasant anticipation stole over their sober faces as
they perceived the platter of scones on the table ready
to be placed on the hot slab of stone in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Knocking the ashes from his pipe, Tam rose
unsteadily to his feet, and standing with his back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to the fire, he admiringly watched the widow as she
bustled to and fro from table to dresser. “Ah, Mistress
Burns, ye’re a fine housekeeper,” he remarked
admiringly. “An’ ye’re a fine cook.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns turned on him sharply. “So is your
guidwife,” she said shortly, glancing out through the
low, deep, square window to where her second son
could be seen crossing the field to the house. She
hoped he would take the hint and go.</p>

<p>“Aye, Mistress, I ken ye’re recht,” replied Tam,
meekly, with a dismal sigh. “But it’s a sorry bet o’
supper I’ll be gang hame to this night, an’ ye ken
it’s a long journey, too, Mistress Burns,” he insinuated
slyly.</p>

<p>“Sure it’s a lang, weary journey, Tam,” said Souter
Johnny, commiseratingly. “But think o’ the
warm welcome ye’ll be haein’ when ye meet your guidwife
at the door,” and a malicious twinkle gleamed in
his kindly but keen old eyes.</p>

<p>“How is your guidwife, Tam O’Shanter?” inquired
Mistress Burns, as she placed some scones on
the hot hearthstone to bake.</p>

<p>“She’s a maist unco woman, Mistress,” replied
Tam sorrowfully. “There’s no livin’ wi’ her o’
late. She’s no a help or comfort to a mon at a’!” he
whined. Here Tam got a delicious whiff of the baking
scones, and his mouth as well as his eyes watered
as he continued pathetically, “If she could only
cook like ye, Mistress. Oh, ’twas a sorry day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Tam O’Shanter when he took such a scoldin’ beldame
for wife,” and Tam sat down, the picture of abject
distress.</p>

<p>Souter regarded his cronie with a grim smile. He
had no pity for Tam, nor for any man, in fact, who
would not or could not rule his own household.
(Souter, by the by, had remained a bachelor.) However,
he did his best to console Tam whenever his
marital troubles were discussed.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Tam,” he said sympathetically,
helping himself to a scone while Mistress Burns’ back
was turned. “Ye ken where ye can find all the comfort
and consolation ye can hold, if ye hae the tippence.”</p>

<p>Tam wiped away a tear (tears came easily to
the old tyke in his constant state of semi-intoxication)
and gave a deep, prolonged sigh. “Aye, Souter, an’
I feel mair at home in the Inn than I do with my guidwife,”
he answered mournfully. “I dinna mind telling
ye, she’s driven me to the Deil himsel’, by her daur
looks an’ ways. The only friend I hae left is Old
John Barleycorn,” and he wailed in maudlin despair.</p>

<p>“He’s your best enemy, ye mean,” retorted Souter
dryly, relighting his pipe, after having demolished,
with evident relish, the last of his stolen scone.</p>

<p>“Waesucks, mon,” he continued, assuming the
tone of Dominie Daddy Auld, who had tried in vain
to convert the two old sinners, much to their amusement
and inward elation. “Your guidwife told ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
weel. Ye’re a skellum, Tam, a blethering, blustering,
drunken blellum,” and the old rogue looked slyly at
Mistress Burns to note the effect of his harangue.</p>

<p>“Aye, ye’re right, Souter Johnny,” said the good
dame, nodding approval to him, and going up to
Tam, who was still sitting groaning by the fireside,
she shook him vigorously by the shoulder. “Stop
your groaning and grunting, ye old tyke, and listen
to me,” she said sharply. “Take your friend’s advice
and gi’ old John Barleycorn a wide berth.”
Here her voice dropped to a whisper, “or some day
ye’ll be catched wi’ warlocks in the mire, Tam
O’Shanter.” He stopped his noise and straightened
up in his chair.</p>

<p>“Aye, and ghosties and witches will come yelpin’
after ye as ye pass the auld haunted kirk at Alloway,”
added Souter sepulchrally, leaning over Tam
with fixed eyes and hand outstretched, clutching spasmodically
at imaginary objects floating before Tam’s
suspicious, angry eyes. Tam, however, was not to
be so easily frightened, and brushing Souter aside, he
jumped to his feet. “Souter Johnny, dinna ye
preach to me, mon,” he roared menacingly. “Ye
hae no reght. Let Daddy Auld do that! I dinna
fear the witches or ghosties, not I.” He staggered
to the window and pointed to an old white horse
standing meekly by the roadside.</p>

<p>“Do ye see any auld faithful Maggie standin’ out
there?” he cried triumphantly. Not waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
their answer, he continued proudly, “Nae witches can
catch Tam O’Shanter when he’s astride his auld
mare’s back, whether he is drunk or sober,” and he
glared defiantly at his listeners. At that moment
the door from the “ben” opened, and Gilbert Burns
entered the room. An angry frown wrinkled his
forehead as his gaze fell upon the two old cronies. A
hard worker himself, he could not abide laziness or
shiftlessness in another. He strode swiftly up to Tam,
who had suddenly lost his defiant attitude, but before
he could speak the bitter, impatient words which
rushed to his lips, his mother, knowing his uncertain
temper, shook her head at him remonstratingly. “Ah,
lad, I’m fair ye hae come in to rest a while, an’ to hae
a bit o’ supper,” she hurriedly said. “Set ye doon.
I hae some scones for ye, an’ Mollie has some rabbit
stew. Noo gie me your bonnet and coat, laddie,” and
taking them from him she hung them on the peg
behind the door, while Gilbert with a look of disgust
at the two old cronies sat down and proceeded
to butter his scones in moody silence. Tam and Souter,
however, did not appear in any wise abashed, and
perceiving they were not to be invited to eat with
Gilbert, they resumed their seats each side of the
fireplace and heaved a disconsolate sigh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns, who had left the room for a moment,
now entered bearing a large bowl of the steaming
stew, which she set before her son, while directly after
her appeared old Mollie Dunn, the half-witted household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
drudge. The time was when Mollie had been
the swiftest mail carrier between Dumfries and
Mauchline, but she was now content to have a home
with the Burns family, where, if the twinges of rheumatism
assailed her, she could rest her bones until
relief came. She now stood, a pleased grin on her
ugly face, watching Gilbert as he helped himself to a
generous portion of the stew which she had proudly
prepared for the evening meal.</p>

<p>“Molly,” said her mistress sharply, “dinna ye
stand there idle; fetch me some hot water frae the
pot.”</p>

<p>Molly got a pan from the rack and hurried to the
fireplace, where Tam was relighting his pipe with
a blazing ember, for the dozenth time. Molly
had no love for Tam, and finding him in her way,
she calmly gave a quick pull to his plaidie, and Tam,
who was in a crouching position, fell backward,
sprawling on the hearth in a decidedly undignified attitude.
With the roar of a wounded lion, he scrambled
to his feet, with the assistance of Souter, and shaking
his fist at the laughing Molly, he sputtered indignantly,
“Is the Deil himsel’ in ye, Molly Dunn?
Ye’re an impudent hussy, that’s what ye are.” Molly
glared at him defiantly for a moment, then calmly proceeded
to fill her pan with hot water, while the old
man, bursting with indignation, staggered over to the
dresser where Mistress Burns was brewing some
tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mistress Burns,” he remonstrated almost tearfully,
“ye should teach your servants better manners.
Molly Dunn is a——” but he never finished his
sentence, for Molly, hurrying back with the hot
water, ran into him and, whether by design or accident
it was never known, spilled the hot contents of the pan
over Tam’s shins, whereupon he gave what resembled
a burlesque imitation of a Highland fling to the
accompaniment of roars of pain and anger from
himself and guffaws of laughter from Souter and
Molly. Even Mrs. Burns and Gilbert could not
resist a smile at the antics of the old tyke.</p>

<p>“Toots, mon,” said Molly, not at all abashed at
the mischief she had done, “ye’re no hurt; ye’ll get
mair than that at hame, I’m tellin’ ye,” and she nodded
her head sagely.</p>

<p>“Molly, hold your tongue,” said Mistress Burns
reprovingly, then she turned to Tam. “I hope ye’re
nae burnt bad.” But Tam was very angry, and turning
to Souter he cried wrathfully, “I’m gang
hame, Souter Johnny. I’ll no stay here to be insulted;
I’m gang hame.” And he started for the
door.</p>

<p>“Dinna mind Molly; she’s daft like,” replied Souter
in a soothing voice. “Come and sit doon,” and
he tried to pull him toward the fireplace, but Tam
was not to be pacified. His dignity had been outraged.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Souter, I thank ye!” he said firmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
“An’ ye, too, Mistress Burns, for your kind invitation
to stay langer,” she looked at him quickly,
then gave a little sniff, “but I ken when I’m insulted,”
and disengaging himself from Souter’s restraining
hand, he started for the door once more.</p>

<p>“An’ where will ye be gang at this hour, Tam?”
insinuated Souter slyly. “Ye ken your guidwife’s
temper.”</p>

<p>“I’m gang over to the Inn,” replied Tam defiantly,
with his hand on the open door. “Will ye
gang alang wi’ me, Souter? A wee droppie will cheer
us both,” he continued persuasively.</p>

<p>Souter looked anxiously at Gilbert’s stern, frowning
face, then back to Tam. “I’d like to amazin’
weel, Tam,” he replied in a plaintive tone, “but ye
see——”</p>

<p>“Johnny has promised me he’ll keep sober till
plantin’ is over,” interrupted Gilbert firmly; “after
that he can do as he likes.”</p>

<p>“Ye should both be ashamed o’ yoursel’s drinkin’
that vile whisky,” said Mrs. Burns angrily, and she
clacked her lips in disgust. “It is your worst enemy,
I’m tellin’ ye.”</p>

<p>“Ye mind, Mistress Burns,” replied Souter, winking
his left eye at Tam, “ye mind the Scriptures
say, ‘Love your enemies.’ Weel, we’re just tryin’ to
obey the Scriptures, eh, Tam?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Souter,” answered Tam with drunken gravity,
“I always obey the Scriptures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, mon, drink a cup of tea before ye gang
awa’,” said Mrs. Burns, and she took him a brimming
cup of the delicious beverage, thinking it might
assuage his thirst for something stronger. Tam
majestically waved it away.</p>

<p>“Nay, I thank ye, Mistress Burns, I’ll no’ deprive
ye of it,” he answered with extreme condescension.
“Tea doesno’ agree with Tam O’Shanter.” He
pushed open the door. “I’m off to the Inn, where
the <i>tea</i> is more to my likin’. Guid-day to ye all,” and,
slamming the door behind him, he called Maggie to
his side, and jumping astride her old back galloped
speedily toward the village Inn. The last heard of
him that day was his voice lustily singing “The
Campbells Are Coming.”</p>

<p>After he left the room Mistress Burns handed
Souter the cup of tea she had poured for Tam, and
soon the silence was unbroken save by an occasional
sigh from the old tyke as he sipped his tea.</p>

<p>Presently Gilbert set down his empty cup, rose
and donned his coat. “Here we are drinking tea,
afternoon tea, as if we were of the quality,” he observed
sarcastically, “instead of being out in the fields
plowing the soil; there’s much to be done ere sundown.”</p>

<p>“Weel, this suits me fine,” murmured Souter
contentedly, draining his cup. “I ken I was born
to be one o’ the quality; work doesno’ agree wi’ me,
o’er weel,” and he snuggled closer in his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye’re very much like my fine brother Robert in
that respect,” answered Gilbert bitterly, his face
growing stern and cold. “But we want no laggards
here on Mossgiel. Farmers must work, an’ work
hard, if they would live.” He walked to the window
and looked out over the untilled ground with hard,
angry eyes, and his heart filled with bitterness as he
thought of his elder brother. It had always fallen to
him to finish the many tasks his dreaming, thoughtless,
erratic brother had left unfinished, while the latter
sought some sequestered spot where, with pencil
and paper in hand, he would idle away his time writing
verses. And for a year now Robert had been in
Irvine, no doubt enjoying himself to the full, while
he, Gilbert, toiled and slaved at home to keep the poor
shelter over his dear ones. It was neither right nor
just, he thought, with an aching heart.</p>

<p>“Ye ken, Gilbert,” said Souter Johnny, breaking
in on his reverie, “Robert wasna’ born to be a
farmer. He always cared more, even when a wee
laddie, for writin’ poetry and dreamin’ o’ the lasses
than toilin’ in the fields, more’s the pity.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns turned on him quickly. “Souter
Johnny, dinna ye dare say a word against Robert,”
she flashed indignantly. “He could turn the best
furrough o’ any lad in these parts, ye ken that
weel,” and Souter was completely annihilated by the
angry flash that gleamed in the mother’s eye, and it
was a very humble Souter that hesitatingly held out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his cup to her, hoping to change the subject. “Hae
ye a wee droppie mair tea there, Mistress Burns?”
he meekly asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns was not to be mollified, however.
“Aye, but not for ye, ye skellum,” she answered
shortly, taking the cup from him and putting it in
the dishpan.</p>

<p>“Come along, Souter,” said Gilbert, going to the
door. “We hae much to do ere sundown and hae
idled too long, noo. Come.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re workin’ me too hard, Gilbert,” groaned
Souter despairingly. “My back is nigh broken;
bide a wee, mon!”</p>

<p>A sharp whistle from without checked Gilbert as
he was about to reply. “The Posty has stopped at
the gate,” exclaimed Mistress Burns excitedly, rushing
to the window in time to see old Molly receive
a letter from that worthy, and then come running
back to the house. Hurrying to the door, she
snatched it from the old servant’s hands and eagerly
held it to the light. Molly peered anxiously over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s frae Robbie,” she exclaimed delightedly.
“Keep quiet, noo, till I read it to the end.” As she
finished, the tears of gladness rolled down her smooth
cheek. “Oh, Gilbert,” she said, a little catch in her
voice, “Robert is comin’ back to us. He’ll be here
this day. Read it, lad, read for yoursel’.” He took
the letter and walked to the fireplace. After a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pause he read it. As she watched him she noticed
with sudden apprehension the look of anger that
darkened his face. She had forgotten the misunderstanding
which had existed between the brothers since
their coming to Mossgiel to live, and suddenly her
heart misgave her.</p>

<p>“Gilbert lad,” she hesitatingly said as he finished
the letter, “dinna say aught to Robert when he
comes hame about his rhyming, will ye, laddie?”
She paused and looked anxiously into his sullen face.
“He canna bear to be discouraged, ye ken,” and she
took the letter from him and put it in her bosom.
Gilbert remained silent and moody, a heavy frown
wrinkling his brow.</p>

<p>“Perhaps all thoughts of poesy has left him
since he has been among strangers,” continued the
mother thoughtfully. “Ye ken he has been doin’
right weel in Irvine; and it’s only because the flax
dresser’s shop has burned to the ground, and he
canna work any more, that he decides to come hame
to help us noo. Ye ken that, Gilbert.” She laid her
hand in tender pleading on his sunburnt arm.</p>

<p>“He always shirked his work before,” replied
Gilbert bitterly, “and nae doot he will again. But
he maun work, an’ work hard, if he wants to stay
at Mossgiel. Nae more lyin’ around, scribblin’ on
every piece of paper he finds, a lot of nonsense,
which willna’ put food in his mouth, nor clothe his
back.” Mrs. Burns sighed deeply and sank into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
low stool beside her spinning wheel, he hands folded
for once idly in her lap, and gave herself up to her
disquieting thoughts.</p>

<p>“Ye can talk all ye like,” exclaimed Souter,
who was ever ready with his advice, “but Robert
is too smart a lad to stay here for lang. He was
never cut out for a farmer nae mair was I.”</p>

<p>“A farmer,” repeated Mrs. Burns, with a mirthless
little laugh. “An’ what is there in a farmer’s
life to pay for all the hardships he endures?” she
asked bitterly. “The constant grindin’ an’ endless
toil crushes all the life out o’ one in the struggle
for existence. Remember your father, Gilbert,”
and her voice broke at the flood of bitter recollection
which crowded her thoughts.</p>

<p>“I have na forgotten him, mither,” replied Gilbert
quietly. “Nor am I likely to, for my ain lot in
life is nae better.” And pulling his cap down over
his eyes, he went back to the window and gazed moodily
out over the bare, rocky, profitless farm which
must be made to yield them a living. There was silence
for a time, broken only by the regular monotonous
ticking of the old clock. After a time Mrs.
Burns quietly left the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, laddie,” whispered Souter as the door closed
behind her, coming up beside Gilbert, “did ye hear
the news that Tam O’Shanter brought frae Mauchline?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean about Robert an’ some lassie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
there?” inquired Gilbert indifferently, after a brief
pause.</p>

<p>“Aye!” returned Souter impressively, “but she’s
nae common lass, Gilbert. She’s Squire Armour’s
daughter Jean, called the Belle of Mauchline.”</p>

<p>“I ken it’s no serious,” replied Gilbert sarcastically,
“for ye ken Robert’s heart is like a tinder
box, that flares up at the first whisper of passion,”
and he turned away from the window and started for
the door.</p>

<p>“I canna’ understand,” reflected Souter, “how
the lad could forget his sweetheart, Highland Mary,
long enough to take up wi any ither lassie. They
were mighty fond o’ each ither before he went awa’ a
year ago. I can swear to that,” and he smiled
reminiscently.</p>

<p>A look of despair swept over Gilbert’s face at the
idle words of the garrulous old man. He leaned
heavily against the door, for there was a dull, aching
pain at his heart of which he was physically conscious.
For a few moments he stood there with white drawn
face, trying hard to realize the bitter truth, that at
last the day had come, as he had feared it must come,
when he must step aside for the prodigal brother who
would now claim his sweetheart. And she would go to
him so gladly, he knew, without a single thought
of his loneliness or his sorrow. But she was not to
blame. It was only right that she should now be
with her sweetheart, that he must say farewell to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
blissful walks along the banks of the Doon which for
almost a year he had enjoyed with Mary by his side.
His stern, tense lips relaxed, and a faint smile softened
his rugged features. How happy he had been
in his fool’s paradise. But he loved her so dearly
that he had been content just to be with her, to listen
to the sweetness of her voice as she prattled
innocently and lovingly of her absent sweetheart.
A snore from Souter, who had fallen asleep in his
chair, roused him from the fond reverie into which he
had fallen, and brought him back to earth with a start.
With a bitter smile he told himself he had no right
to complain. If he had allowed himself to fall in
love with his brother’s betrothed, he alone was to
blame, and he must suffer the consequence. Suddenly
a wild thought entered his brain. Suppose—and his
heart almost stopped beating at the thought—suppose
Robert had grown to love someone else, while
away, even better than he did Mary? He had heard
rumors of Robert’s many amourous escapades in
Mauchline; then perhaps Mary would again turn to
him for comfort. His eyes shone with renewed hope
and his heart was several degrees lighter as he left
the house. Going to the high knoll back of the cottage,
he gazed eagerly, longingly, across the moor
to where, in the hazy distance, the lofty turrets of
Castle Montgomery, the home of the winsome dairymaid,
Mary Campbell, reared their heads toward the
blue heavens.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ye banks and braes and streams around</div>
<div class="verse">The Castle of Montgomery,</div>
<div class="verse">Green be your woods and fair your flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">Your waters never drumlie,</div>
<div class="verse">There summer first unfolds her robes,</div>
<div class="verse">And there the langest tarry,</div>
<div class="verse">For there I took the last farewell</div>
<div class="verse">O’ my sweet Highland Mary.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the foot of the hill on which stood Castle Montgomery
flowed the River Doon, winding and twisting
itself through richly wooded scenery on its way
to Ayr Bay. On the hillside of the stream stood the
old stone dairy, covered with ivy and shaded by overhanging
willows. Within its cool, shady walls the
merry lassies sang at their duties, with hearts as
light and carefree as the birds that flew about the
open door. Their duties over for the day, they had
returned to their quarters in the long, low wing of
the castle, and silence reigned supreme over the
place, save for the trickling of the Doon splashing
over the stones as it wended its tuneful way to join
the waters of the Ayr.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was broken; borne on the
evening breeze came the sound of a sweet, high
voice singing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh where and oh where is my Highland laddie gone,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">sang the sweet singer, plaintively from the hilltop.
Nearer and nearer it approached as the owner followed
the winding path down to the river’s bank.
Suddenly the drooping willows were parted, and there
looked out the fairest face surely that mortal eyes
had ever seen.</p>

<p>About sixteen years of age, with ringlets of flaxen
hair flowing unconfined to her waist, laughing blue
eyes, bewitchingly overarched by dark eyebrows, a
rosebud mouth, now parted in song, between two
rounded dimpled cheeks, such was the bonnie face
of Mary Campbell, known to all around as “Highland
Mary.” Removing her plaidie, which hung
gracefully from one shoulder, she spread it on the
mossy bank, and, casting herself down full length
upon it, her head pillowed in her hand, she finished
her song, lazily, dreamily, letting it die out, slowly,
softly floating into nothingness. Then for a moment
she gave herself up to the mere joy of living,
watching the leaves as they fell noiselessly into the
stream and were carried away, away until they were
lost to vision. Gradually her thoughts became more
centered. That particular spot was full of sweet
memories to her. It was here, she mused dreamily,
that she and Robert had parted a year ago. It was
here on the banks of the Doon they so often had
met and courted and loved, and here it was they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stood hand in hand and plighted their troth, while
the murmuring stream seemed to whisper softly,
“For eternity, for all eternity.” And here in this
sequestered spot, on that second Sunday of May,
they had spent the day in taking a last farewell.
Would she ever forget it? Oh, the pain of that
parting! Her eyes filled with tears at the recollection
of her past misery. But she brushed them quickly
away with a corner of her scarf. He had promised to
send for her when he was getting along well, and she
had been waiting day after day for that summons,
full of faith in his word. For had he not said as he
pressed her to his heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I hae sworn by the heavens to my Mary,</div>
<div class="verse">I hae sworn by the heavens to be true.</div>
<div class="verse">And so may the heavens forget me,</div>
<div class="verse">When I forget my vow.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A whole year had passed. She had saved all
her little earnings, and now her box was nearly filled
with the linen which she had spun and woven with
her own fair hands, for she did not mean to come dowerless
to her husband. In a few months, so he had
written in his last letter, he would send for her to
come to him, and they would start for the new
country, America, where gold could be picked up in
the streets (so she had heard it said). They could
not help but prosper, and so the child mused on happily.
The sudden blast of a horn interrupted her
sweet day dreams, and, hastily jumping to her feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with a little ejaculation of dismay she tossed her
plaidie over her back, and, filling her pail from the
brook, swung it lightly to her strong young shoulder.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“An’ it’s o’ in my heart, I wish him safe at home,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">she trilled longingly, as she retraced her steps up the
winding path, over the hill, and back to the kitchen,
where, after giving the pail into the hand of Bess, the
good-natured cook, she leaned against the lintel of the
door, her hands shading her wistful eyes, and gazed
long and earnestly off to where the sun was sinking
behind the horizon in far-off Irvine. So wrapped was
she in her thoughts she failed to hear the whistle of
Rory Cam, the Posty, and the bustle and confusion
which his coming had created within the kitchen. The
sharp little shrieks and ejaculations of surprise and
delight, however, caused her to turn her head inquiringly.
Looking through the open door, she saw Bess
in the center of a gaping crowd of servants, reading a
letter, the contents of which had evoked the delight of
her listeners. “An’ he’ll be here this day,” cried Bess
loudly, folding her letter. “Where’s Mary Campbell?”
she demanded, looking around the room.</p>

<p>“Here I am, Bess,” said Mary, standing shyly at
the door.</p>

<p>“Hae ye heard the news, then, lassie?” asked Bess,
grinning broadly.</p>

<p>“Nay; what news?” inquired Mary, wondering
why they all looked at her so knowingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve just had word frae my sister in Irvine, an’
she said——” Here Bess paused impressively.
“She said that Rob Burns was burnt out o’ his place,
an’ that he would be comin’ hame to-day.” Bess, who
had good-naturedly wished to surprise Mary, was
quite startled to see her turn as white as a lily and
stagger back against the door with a little gasp
of startled surprise.</p>

<p>“Are ye sure, Bess?” she faltered, her voice shaking
with eagerness.</p>

<p>“It’s true as Gospel, lassie; I’ll read ye the
letter,” and Bess started to take it out, but with
a cry of joy Mary rushed through the door like a
startled fawn, and before the astonished maids could
catch their breath she had lightly vaulted over the
hedge and was flying down the hill and over the moor
toward Mossgiel farm with the speed of a swallow,
her golden hair floating behind her like a cloud of
glorious sunshine. On, on she sped, swift as the
wind, and soon Mossgiel loomed up in the near distance.
Not stopping for breath, she soon reached
the door, and without pausing to knock burst into the
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns had put the house in order and, with a
clean ’kerchief and cap on, sat patiently at her wheel,
waiting for Robert to come home, while Souter quietly
sat in the corner winding a ball of yarn from the
skein which hung over the back of the chair, and
looking decidedly sheepish. When Mary burst in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the door so unceremoniously they both jumped
expectantly to their feet, thinking surely it was
Robert.</p>

<p>“Why, Mary lass, is it ye?” said Mrs. Burns in
surprise. “Whatever brings ye over the day? not
but we are glad to have ye,” she added hospitably.</p>

<p>“Where is he, Mistress Burns, where’s Robbie?”
she panted excitedly, her heart in her voice.</p>

<p>“He isna’ here yet, lassie,” replied Mrs. Burns,
with a sigh. “But sit ye doon. Take off your
plaidie and wait for him. There’s a girlie,” and she
pushed the unresisting girl into a chair.</p>

<p>“Ye’re sure he isna’ here, Mistress Burns?” asked
Mary wistfully, looking around the room with eager,
searching eyes.</p>

<p>“Aye, lassie,” she replied, smiling; “if he were
he wouldna’ be hidin’ from ye, dearie, and after
a year of absence, too. But I ken he will be here
soon noo.” And she went to the window and looked
anxiously out across the moor.</p>

<p>“It seems so lang since he left Mossgiel, doesna’
it, Mistress Burns?” said Mary with a deep sigh of
disappointment.</p>

<p>“An’ weel ye might say that,” replied Mrs. Burns.
“For who doesna’ miss my laddie,” and she tossed
her head proudly. “There isna’ another like Robbie
in all Ayrshire. A bright, honest, upright, pure-minded
lad, whom any mither might be proud of.
I hope he’ll return to us the same laddie he was when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he went awa’.” The anxious look returned to her
comely face.</p>

<p>An odd little smile appeared about the corners
of Souter’s mouth as he resumed his work.</p>

<p>“Weel, noo, Mistress Burns,” he asked dryly,
“do ye expect a healthy lad to be out in this sinful
world an’ not learn a few things he didna ken
before? ’Tis only human nature,” continued the
old rogue, “an’ ye can learn a deal in a year, mind
that, an’ that reminds me o’ a good joke. Sandy
MacPherson——”</p>

<p>“Souter Johnny, ye keep your stories to yoursel’,”
interrupted Mrs. Burns with a frown. Souter’s
stories were not always discreet.</p>

<p>“Irvine and Mauchline are very gay towns,” continued
Souter reminiscently. “They say some of
the prettiest gurls of Scotlan’ live there, an’ I hear
they all love Robbie Burns, too,” he added slyly,
looking at Mary out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>“They couldna help it,” replied Mary sweetly.</p>

<p>“An’ ye’re nae jealous, Mary?” he inquired in a
surprised tone, turning to look into the flushed, shy
face beside him.</p>

<p>“Jealous of Robert?” echoed Mary, opening her
innocent eyes to their widest. “Nay! for I ken he
loves me better than any other lassie in the world.”
And she added naïvely, “He has told me so ofttimes.”</p>

<p>“Ye needna fear, Mary,” replied Mrs. Burns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
resuming her place at the wheel. “I’ll hae no ither
lass but ye for my daughter, depend on’t.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, Mistress Burns,” said Mary brightly.
“I ken I’m only a simple country lass, but I mean
to learn all I can, so that when he becomes a great
man he’ll no be ashamed of me, for I ken he will be
great some day,” she continued, her eyes flashing,
the color coming and going in her cheek as she predicted
the future of the lad she loved. “He’s a
born poet, Mistress Burns, and some day ye’ll be
proud of your lad, for genius such as Rabbie’s
canna always be hid.” Mrs. Burns gazed at the
young girl in wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh, if someone would only encourage him,” continued
Mary earnestly, “for I’m fair sure his heart
is set on rhyming.”</p>

<p>“I ne’er heard of a body ever makin’ money writin’
verses,” interposed Souter, rubbing his chin reflectively
with the ball of soft yarn.</p>

<p>“Ah, me,” sighed Mrs. Burns, her hands idle for
a moment, “I fear the lad does but waste his time
in such scribbling. Who is to hear it? Only his
friends, who are partial to him, of course, but who,
alas, are as puir as we are, and canna assist him in
bringin’ them before the public. The fire burns out
for lack of fuel,” she continued slowly, watching the
flickering sparks die one by one in the fireplace. “So
will his love of writin’ when he sees how hopeless it
all is.” She paused and sighed deeply. “He maun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
do mair than write verses to keep a wife and family
from want,” she continued earnestly, and she looked
sadly at Mary’s downcast face. “And, Mary, ye
too will hae to work, harder than ye hae ever known,
even as I have; so hard, dearie, that the heart grows
sick and weary and faint in the struggle to keep the
walf awa’.”</p>

<p>“I am no afraid of hard work,” answered Mary
bravely, swallowing the sympathetic tears which rose
to her eyes. “If poverty is to be his portion I shall
na shrink from sharin’ it wi’ him,” and her eyes
shone with love and devotion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns rose and put her arms lovingly about
her. “God bless ye, dearie,” she said softly, smoothing
the tangled curls away from the broad low brow
with tender, caressing fingers.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Mary, as the wail of the bagpipes
was heard in the distance. “’Tis old blind
Donald,” and running to the window she threw back
the sash with a cry of delight. “Oh, how I love the
music of the pipes!” she murmured passionately, and
her sweet voice vibrated with feeling, for she thought
of her home so far away in the Highlands and the
dear ones she had not seen for so long.</p>

<p>“Isna he the merry one this day,” chuckled
Souter, keeping time with his feet and hands, not
heeding the yarn, which had slipped from the chair,
and which was fast becoming entangled about his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s fair inspirin’!” cried Mary, clapping her
hands ecstatically. “Doesna it take ye back to the
Highlands, Souter?” she asked happily.</p>

<p>“Aye, lassie,” replied Souter. “But it’s there
among the hills and glens that the music of the
pipes is most entrancin’,” he added loyally, for he
was a true Highlander. The strains of the “Cock
of the North” grew louder and louder as old Donald
drew near the farm, and Mary, who could no
longer restrain her joyous impulse, with a little excited
laugh, her face flushing rosily, ran to the
center of the room, where, one hand on her hip, her
head tossed back, she began to dance. Her motion
was harmony itself as she gracefully swayed to and
fro, darting here and there like some elfin sprite,
her bare feet twinkling like will-o’-the-wisps, so
quickly did they dart in and out from beneath her
short plaid skirt. With words of praise they both
encouraged her to do her best.</p>

<p>Louder and louder the old piper blew, quicker and
quicker the feet of the dancer sped, till, with a gasp
of exhaustion, Mary sank panting into the big armchair,
feeling very warm and very tired, but very
happy.</p>

<p>“Ye dance bonnie, dearie, bonnie,” exclaimed Mrs.
Burns delightedly, pouring her a cup of tea, which
Mary drank gratefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, dearie me,” Mary said apologetically, putting
down her empty cup, “whatever came o’er me?
I’m a gaucie wild thing this day, for true, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
canna held dancin’ when I hear the pipes,” and she
smiled bashfully into the kind face bent over her.</p>

<p>“Music affects me likewise,” replied Souter, trying
to untangle the yarn from around his feet, but
only succeeding in making a bad matter worse.
“Music always goes to my feet like whusky, only
whusky touches me here first,” and he tapped his head
humorously with his forefinger.</p>

<p>“Souter Johnny, ye skellum!” cried Mrs. Burns,
noticing for the first time the mischief he had
wrought. “Ye’re not worth your salt, ye ne’er-do-weel.
Ye’ve spoiled my yarn,” and she glared at the
crestfallen Souter with fire in her usually calm eye.</p>

<p>“It was an accident, Mistress Burns,” stammered
Souter, awkwardly shifting his weight from one foot
to the other in his efforts to free himself from the persistent
embrace of the clinging yarn.</p>

<p>With no gentle hand Mrs. Burns shoved him into a
chair and proceeded to extricate his feet from the
tangled web which held him prisoner. Soon she freed
the offending members and rose to her feet. “Noo
gang awa’,” she sputtered. “Ye’ve vexed me sair.
Gang out and help Gilbert. I canna bide ye round.”
Souter took his Tam O’Shanter, which hung over the
fireplace, and ambled to the door.</p>

<p>“Very weel,” he said meekly, “I’ll go. Souter
Johnny can take a hint as weel as the next mon,”
and he closed the door gently behind him and slowly
wended his way across the field to where Gilbert was
sitting, dreamily looking across the moor.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>“Why doesna he come, Mistress Burns?” said Mary
pathetically. They had come down to the field where
Gilbert was now at work the better to watch for their
loved one’s approach. “Twilight is comin’ on an’
’tis a lang walk to Castle Montgomery at night. I
canna wait much langer noo.”</p>

<p>“Never ye mind, lassie; ye shall stay the night
with me,” replied Mrs. Burns soothingly, “if Robert
doesna come.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take ye back, Mary,” said Gilbert eagerly,
going up to her. Perhaps Robert was not coming
after all, he thought with wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, Gilbert, but I’ll wait a wee bit longer,”
answered Mary hopefully; “perhaps he’ll be here
soon,” and she dejectedly dug her bare toes into the
damp earth.</p>

<p>“Well, lassie, I canna waste any mair time,”
said Mrs. Burns energetically. “Ye can stay
here with Gilbert, while I return to my spinning.
Come, Souter, there’s some firewood to be split,”
and she quickly walked to the house, followed more
slowly by the reluctant Souter.</p>

<p>Gilbert, with his soul in his eyes, feasted on the
pathetic loveliness of the sweet face beside him, gazing
wistfully toward Mauchline, and his aching heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
yearned to clasp her to his breast, to tell her of his
love, to plead for her pity, her love, herself, for he
felt he would rather die than give her up to another.
He drew closer to her.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Gilbert?” asked Mary anxiously,
noting his pale face. “Are ye in pain?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Mary, in pain,” he answered passionately.
“Such pain I’ll hope ye’ll never know.” He bowed
his head.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry, lad,” she replied innocently. “I
wish I could help ye,” and she looked compassionately
at the suffering man.</p>

<p>He raised his head suddenly and looked into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Are ye goin’ to marry Robert this summer, when
he returns?” he asked abruptly, his voice husky with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Aye, if he wishes it,” answered Mary simply,
wondering why he looked so strangely white.</p>

<p>“He has been gone a year, ye ken,” continued
Gilbert hoarsely. “Suppose he has changed and no
langer loves ye?” She looked at him with big, frightened
eyes. She had never thought of that possibility
before. What if he did no longer love her? she
thought fearfully. She looked about her helplessly.
She felt bewildered, dazed; slowly she sank down on
the rocky earth, her trembling limbs refusing to support
her. Her fair head drooped pathetically, like
a lily bent and bruised by the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“If Robert doesna want me any more,” she murmured
after a pause, a pathetic little catch in her
voice, “if he loves someone else better than he does
his Highland Mary, then I—I——”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll soon forget him, Mary,” interrupted Gilbert
eagerly, his heart throbbing with hope. She
raised her eyes from which all the light had flown
and looked at him sadly, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Nay, lad, I wouldna care to live any longer,”
she said quietly. “My heart would just break,”
and she smiled a pitiful little smile which smote him
like a knife thrust. He caught her two hands in
his passionately and pressed them to his heart with
a cry of pain.</p>

<p>“Dinna mind what I said, lass,” he cried, conscience
stricken; “dinna look like that. I dinna
mean to grieve ye, Mary, I love ye too well.” And
almost before he realized it he had recklessly, passionately,
incoherently told her of his love for her, his
jealousy of his brother, his grief and pain at losing
her. Mary gazed at him in wonder, scarcely understanding
his wild words, his excited manner.</p>

<p>“I’m fair pleased that ye love me, Gilbert,” she
answered him in her innocence. “Ye ken I love ye
too, for ye’ve been so kind and good to me ever
since Robert has been awa’,” and she pressed his
hand affectionately. With a groan of despair he
released her and turned away without another word.
Suddenly she understood, and a great wave of sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
welled up in her heart. “Oh, Gilbert,” she
cried sorrowfully, a world of compassion in her
voice. “I understand ye noo, laddie, an’ I’m so
sorry, so sorry.” He bit his lips till the blood came.
Finally he spoke in a tone of quiet bitterness.</p>

<p>“I’ve been living in a fool’s paradise this past
year,” he said, “but ’tis all ended noo. Why, ever
since he went awa’ I have wished, hoped, and even
prayed that Rob would never return to Mossgiel,
that ye might forget him and his accursed poetry,
and in time would become my wife.” He threw out
his hands with a despairing gesture as he finished.</p>

<p>“Oh, Gilbert,” she faltered, with tears in her
eyes, “I never dreamed ye thought of me in that
way. Had I only known, I——” she broke off
abruptly and looked away toward the cottage.</p>

<p>“Ye see what a villain I have been,” he continued
with a bitter smile. “But ye have nothin’
to blame yoursel’ for, Mary. I had no right to
think of ye ither than as Robert’s betrothed wife.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry, lad,” repeated Mary compassionately.
Then her downcast face brightened. “Let
us both forget what has passed this day, and be
the same good friends as ever, wi’na we, Gilbert?”
And she held out her hand to him with her old winning
smile.</p>

<p>“God bless ye, lassie,” he replied brokenly. Quietly
they stood there for a few minutes, then with a sudden
start they realized that deep twilight had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
upon them. Silently, stealthily it had descended,
like a quickly drawn curtain. Slowly they wended
their way back to the cottage. When they reached
the door Mary suddenly turned and peered into the
deepening twilight.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said breathlessly. “Dinna ye hear
a voice, Gilbert?” He listened for a minute.
Faintly there came on the still air the distant murmur
of many voices.</p>

<p>“’Tis only the lads on their way to the village,”
he replied quietly. With a little shiver, Mary drew
her plaidie closely about her, for the air had grown
cool.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll hae to be goin’ noo,” she said dejectedly.
“He willna be here this night.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Gilbert. “I’ll saddle the
mare and take ye back. Bide here a wee,” and he
left her. She could hardly restrain the disappointed
tears, which rose to her eyes.</p>

<p>Why didn’t Robert come? What could keep him
so late? She so longed to see her laddie once more.
She idly wondered why the lads, whose voices she now
heard quite plainly, were coming toward Mossgiel.
There was no inn hereabouts. By the light of the
rising moon she saw them on the moor, ever drawing
nearer and nearer, but they had no interest for her.
Nothing interested her now. She leaned back against
the wall of the cottage and patiently awaited Gilbert’s
return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s comin’! he’s comin’!” suddenly exclaimed
the voice of Mrs. Burns from within the cottage.
“My lad is comin’! Out of my way, ye skellum!”
and out she ran, her face aglow with love and excitement,
followed by Souter, who was shouting gleefully,
“He’s comin’! he’s comin’! Robbie’s comin’!”
and off he sped in her footsteps, to meet the returned
wanderer.</p>

<p>“It’s Robbie! it’s Robbie!” cried Mary joyously,
her nerves a-quiver, as she heard the vociferous outburst
of welcome from the lads, who were bringing
him in triumph to his very door.</p>

<p>“Welcome hame, laddie!” shouted the crowd, as
they came across the field, singing, laughing and
joking like schoolboys on a frolic.</p>

<p>“Oh, I canna’, I darena’ meet him before them a’,”
she exclaimed aloud, blushing rosily, frightened at the
thought of meeting him before the good-natured
country folk.</p>

<p>She would wait till they all went away, and, turning,
she ran into the house like a timid child. Quickly
she hid behind the old fireplace, listening shyly, as
she heard them approach the open door.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, lads, for your kind welcome,” said
Robert as he reached the threshold, one arm around
his mother. “I didna’ ken I had left so many friends
in Mossgiel,” and he looked around gratefully at the
rugged faces that were grinning broadly into his.</p>

<p>“Come doon to the Inn and hae a wee nippie for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
auld lang syne,” sang out Sandy MacPherson, with
an inviting wave of the hand.</p>

<p>“Nay, an’ he’ll not gang a step, Sandy MacPherson,”
cried Mrs. Burns indignantly, clinging
closely to her son.</p>

<p>“Nay, I thank ye, Sandy,” laughingly replied
Robert. “Ye must excuse me to-night. I’ll see ye
all later, and we’ll have a lang chat o’er auld times.”</p>

<p>“Come awa’ noo, Robert,” said Mrs. Burns lovingly,
“an’ I’ll get ye a bite and a sup,” and she
drew him into the house.</p>

<p>“Good-night, lads; I’ll see ye to-morrow,” he
called back to them cheerily.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” they answered in a chorus, and
with “three cheers for Robbie Burns” that made the
welkin ring, they departed into the night, merrily
singing “Should auld acquaintance be forgot?” a
song Robert himself had written before leaving
Mossgiel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>“Ah, Souter Johnny, how are ye, mon?” cried Robert
heartily, as his eyes rested on the beaming face of
the old man. “Faith, an’ I thought I’d find ye here
as of old. ’Tis almost a fixture ye are.”</p>

<p>“Ah, weel,” replied Souter nonchalantly, as he
shook Robert’s outstretched hand, “ye ken the
Scripture says, ‘an’ the poor ye have always wi’
ye.’” Robert laughed merrily at the old man’s
sally.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, they’ve gone at last,” said Mrs.
Burns with a sigh of relief, as she entered the room.
“Why, laddie, ye had half the ne’er-do-weels of Mossgiel
a-following ye. They are only a lot of leeches
and idle brawlers, that’s a’,” and her dark eyes
flashed her disapproval.</p>

<p>“I’m sure they have kind hearts, mither, for a’
that,” replied Robert reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Ye’re so popular wi’ them a’, Robbie,” cried
Souter proudly.</p>

<p>“Aye, when he has a shillin’ to spend on them,”
added Mrs. Burns dryly. “But sit doon, laddie;
ye maun be tired wi’ your lang walk,” and she gently
pushed him into a chair beside the table.</p>

<p>“I am a wee bittie tired,” sighed Robert gratefully
as he leaned back in the chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll soon hae something to eat before ye,” replied
his mother briskly.</p>

<p>“I’m nae hungry, mother,” answered Robert.
“Indeed, I couldna’ eat a thing,” he remonstrated
as she piled the food before him.</p>

<p>“’Tis in love ye are,” insinuated Souter with a
knowing look. “I ken the symptoms weel; ye canna’
eat.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re wrong there,” replied Robert with a bright
smile. “Love but increases my appetite.”</p>

<p>“Aye, for love,” added Souter <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>“Ah, mother dear, how guid it seems to be at hame
again, under the old familiar roof-tree,” said Robert
a little later, as he leaned back contentedly in his
chair and gazed about the room with eager, alert
glances. As he sits there with his arms folded let
us take a look at our hero. Of more than medium
height, his form suggested agility as well as strength.
His high forehead, shaded with black curling hair
tied at the neck, indicated extensive capacity. His
eyes were large, dark, and full of fire and intelligence.
His face was well formed and uncommonly interesting
and expressive, although at the first glance his
features had a certain air of coarseness, mingled with
an expression of calm thoughtfulness, approaching
melancholy. He was dressed carelessly in a blue
homespun long coat, belted at the waist, over a buff-colored
vest; short blue pantaloons, tucked into long
gray home-knit stockings, which came up above his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
knee, and broad low brogans, made by Souter’s hands.
He wore a handsome plaid of small white and black
checks over one shoulder, the ends being brought
together under the opposite arm and tied loosely
behind.</p>

<p>“’Tis a fine hame-comin’ ye’ve had, laddie,” cried
old Souter proudly. “Faith, it’s just like they
give the heir of grand estates. We should hae had
a big bonfire burnin’ outside our—ahem—palace
gates,” and he waved his hand grandiloquently.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ ye make fun of our poor clay biggin’,
Souter Johnny,” cried Mrs. Burns rebukingly. “Be
it ever so poor, ’tis our hame.”</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis our hame, mother,” repeated Robert
lovingly. “An’ e’en tho’ I have been roaming in
other parts, still this humble cottage is the dearest
spot on earth to me. I love it all, every stick and
stone, each blade of grass, every familiar object that
greeted my eager gaze as I crossed the moor to this
haven of rest, my hame. And my love for it this
moment is the strongest feeling within me.”</p>

<p>His roving eyes tenderly sought out one by one
the familiar bits of furniture around the room, and
lingered for a moment lovingly on the old fireplace.
It was there he had first seen Mary Campbell. She
had come to the cottage on an errand, and as she
stood leaning against the mantel, the sunlight gleaming
through the window upon her golden hair, he
had entered the room. It was plainly love at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sight, and so he had told her that same day, as he
walked back to Castle Montgomery with the winsome
dairymaid. The course of their love had flowed
smoothly and uneventfully; he loved her with all the
depth of his passionate emotional nature, and yet
his love was more spiritual than physical. She was
an endless source of inspiration, as many a little song
and ode which had appeared in the Tarbolton weekly
from time to time could testify. How long the
year had been away from her, he mused dreamily.
To-morrow, bright and early, he would hurry over
to Castle Montgomery and surprise her at her
duties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Gazed straight into the startled eyes of Robert.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mary, from her hiding place, had watched all that
happened since Robert had come into the room.
She had not expected to remain so long hidden, she
thought wistfully. She had hoped that Mrs. Burns
would miss her, and that she, or Robert, or someone
would look for her, but they had not even
thought of her, and her lips trembled piteously at
their neglect. And so she had stayed on, peeping out
at them, whenever their backs were turned, feeling
very lonely, and very miserable, in spite of the pride
that thrilled her, as she watched her lover sitting
there so handsome in the full strength of his young
manhood. Perhaps they didn’t want her here to-night.
Perhaps it was true, as Gilbert said, “that
Robert didn’t love her any more.” The tears could
no longer be restrained. If she could only slip out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unobserved she would go home. She wasn’t afraid,
she thought miserably. She wondered what they
were doing now, they were so quiet? Peering shyly
around the mantel, she gazed straight into the
startled eyes of Robert, who with a surprised ejaculation
started back in amazement.</p>

<p>“Why, Mary Campbell!” cried his mother remorsefully,
as she caught sight of Mary’s face, “I
declare I clear forgot ye, lass.” With a glad cry
Robert sprang toward her and grasped her two hands
in his own, his eyes shining with love and happiness.</p>

<p>“Mary, lass, were ye hidin’ awa’ from me?” he
asked in tender reproach. She dropped her head
bashfully without a word. “’Tis o’er sweet in ye,
dear, to come over to welcome me hame,” he continued
radiantly. “Come an’ let me look at ye,” and
he drew her gently to where the candle light could
fall on her shy, flushed face. “Oh, ’tis bonnie ye’re
looking, lassie,” he cried proudly. He raised her
drooping head, so that his hungry eyes could
feast on her beauty. She stood speechless, like a
frightened child, not daring to raise her eyes to his.
“Haven’t ye a word of welcome for me, sweetheart?”
he whispered tenderly, drawing her to him
caressingly.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m very glad to hae ye back again,” she
faltered softly, her sweet voice scarcely audible.</p>

<p>“Go an’ kiss him, Mary; dinna’ mind us,” cried
Souter impatiently. “I can see ye’re both asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for it wi’ your eyes,” he insinuated. And he drew
near them expectantly.</p>

<p>“Hauld your whist, ye old tyke,” flashed Mrs.
Burns indignantly. “Robbie Burns doesna’ need ye
to tell him how to act wi’ the lassies.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not dispute ye there,” replied Souter dryly,
winking his eye at Robert knowingly.</p>

<p>Robert laughed merrily as he answered, “Ye ken
we’re both o’er bashful before ye a’.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ye’re a fine pair of lovers, ye are,” retorted
Souter disgustedly, turning away.</p>

<p>“So the neighbors say, Souter,” responded Robert
gayly, giving Mary a loving little squeeze.</p>

<p>And surely there never was a handsomer couple,
thought Mistress Burns proudly, as they stood there
together. One so dark, so big and strong, the other
so fair, so fragile and winsome. And so thought
Gilbert Burns jealously, as he came quietly into the
room. Robert went to him quickly, a smile lighting
up his dark face, his hand outstretched in
greeting.</p>

<p>“I’m o’er glad to see ye again, Gilbert,” he cried
impulsively, shaking his brother’s limp hand.</p>

<p>“So ye’ve come back again,” said Gilbert, coldly.</p>

<p>“Aye, like a bad penny,” laughingly responded
Robert. “Noo that I am burned out of my situation,
I’ve come hame to help ye in the labors of the
farm,” and he pressed his brother’s hand warmly.</p>

<p>“I fear your thoughts willna’ lang be on farming,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
observed Gilbert sarcastically, going to the
fireplace and deliberately turning his back to Robert.</p>

<p>“I’ll struggle hard to keep them there, brother,”
replied Robert simply. His brother’s coldness had
chilled his extraordinarily sensitive nature. He
walked slowly back to his seat.</p>

<p>“I ken ye’d rather be writin’ love verses than
farmin’, eh, Robert?” chimed in Souter thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>“’Tis only a waste of time writin’ poetry, my lad,”
sighed Mrs. Burns, shaking her head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“I canna’ help writin’, mother,” answered the lad
firmly, a trifle defiantly. “For the love of poesy
was born in me, and that love was fostered at your
ain knee ever since my childhood days.”</p>

<p>She sighed regretfully. “I didna’ ken what seed
I was sowing then, laddie,” she answered thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ be discouraged,” cried Mary eagerly,
going to him. “I’ve faith in ye, laddie, and in
your poetry, too.” She put her hand on his shoulder
lovingly, as he sat beside the table, looking
gloomy and dejected. “Some day,” she continued,
a thrill of pride in her voice, “ye’ll wake to find
your name on everybody’s lips. You’ll be rich and
famous, mayhap. Who kens, ye may even become
the Bard o’ Scotland,” she concluded in an awestruck
tone.</p>

<p>“Nay, Mary, I do not hope for that,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Robert, his dark countenance relaxing into a smile
of tenderness at her wild prophecy, although in his
own heart he felt conscious of superior talents.</p>

<p>“Waesucks,” chuckled Souter reminiscently. “Do
you mind, Robbie, how, a year ago, ye riled up the
community, an’ the kirk especially, over your verses
called ‘Holy Willie’s Prayer’? Aye, lad, it was an
able keen satire, and auld Squire Armour recognized
the truth of it, for he threatened to hae ye arrested
for blaspheming the kirk and the auld licht religion.
He’ll ne’er forgive ye for that,” and he shook his
head with conviction.</p>

<p>“He’s an auld Calvinistic hypocrite,” replied Robert
carelessly, “and he deserved to be satirized alang
wi’ the rest of the Elders. Let us hope the verses
may do them and the kirk some good. They are
sadly in need of reform.” Then with a gay laugh
he told them a funny anecdote concerning one of
the Elders, and for over an hour they listened to
the rich tones of his voice as he entertained them
with jest and song and story, passing quickly from
one to the other, as the various emotions succeeded
each other in his mind, assuming with equal ease the
expression of the broadest mirth, the deepest melancholy
or the most sublime emotion. They sat around
him spellbound. Never had they seen him in such
a changeable mood as to-night.</p>

<p>“And noo, laddie, tell us about your life in Irvine
and Mauchline,” said Mrs. Burns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert had finished his last story, and sat in meditative
silence, watching the smoldering peat in the
fireplace.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. “There is little to
tell, mother,” he answered, not looking up, “and that
little is na worth tellin’.”</p>

<p>“I ken ye’ve come back no richer in pocket than
when ye left,” remarked Gilbert questioningly. As
his brother made no answer, he continued with sarcastic
irony, “But perhaps there wasna’ enough
work for ye there.” He watched his brother’s face
narrowly.</p>

<p>“There was work enough for a’,” replied Robert
in a low tone, an agony of remorse in his voice. “An’
I tried to fulfill faithfully the uncongenial tasks set
before me, but I would sink into dreams, forgetting
my surroundings, my duties, and would set me doon
to put on paper the thoughts and fancies which came
rushing through my brain, raging like so many devils,
till they found vent in rhyme; then the conning o’er
my verses like a spell soothed all into quiet again.”
A far away rapt expression came over his countenance
as he finished, and his dark glowing eyes
gazed dreamily into space, as if communing with
the Muses. Mrs. Burns and Mary both watched him
with moist, adoring eyes, hardly breathing lest they
should disturb his reverie. Gilbert stirred in his
chair restlessly.</p>

<p>“Ye will never prosper unless ye give up this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dreaming,” he exclaimed impatiently, rising from his
chair and pacing the floor.</p>

<p>Robert looked up, the fire fading from his eyes,
his face growing dark and forbidding. “I ken that
weel, Gilbert,” he answered bitterly. “An’ I despair
of ever makin’ anything of mysel’ in this world,
not e’en a poor farmer. I am not formed for the
bustle of the busy nor the flutter of the gay. I’m
but an idle rhymster, a ne’er-do-weel.” He walked
quickly to the window and stood dejectedly looking
out into the night.</p>

<p>“Nay, ye’re a genius, lad,” declared old Souter
emphatically, patting him affectionately on the
shoulder. “I havena’ watched your erratic ways for
nothin’, an’ I say ye’re a genius. It’s a sad thing to
be a genius, Robert, an’ I sympathize wi’ ye,” and the
old hypocrite shook his head dolefully as he took his
seat at the fireplace.</p>

<p>“I’m a failure, I ken that weel. I’m a failure,”
muttered Robert despairingly, his heart heavy and
sad.</p>

<p>“Nay, laddie, ye mustna’ talk like that,’tis not
right,” cried Mary, bravely keeping back the sympathetic
tears from her eyes and forcing a little
smile to her lips. “Ye are only twenty-five,” she
continued earnestly. “An’ all your life is stretchin’
out before ye. Why, ye mustna ever think o’
failure. Ye must think only of bright, happy things,
and ye’ll see how everythin’ will come out all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Noo mind that. So cheer thee, laddie, or ye’ll make
us all sad on this your hame-comin’. Come, noo,
look pleasant,” and she gave his arm a loving little
shake. As his stern face melted into a sad smile,
she laughed happily. “That’s right, laddie.” With
a little encouraging nod she left him, and running
to Mrs. Burns, she gave her a hug and a kiss, until
the old lady’s grim features relaxed. Then like a
bird she flitted to the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“Souter Johnny,” she saucily cried, “how dare
ye look so mournful like. Hae ye a fit o’ the gloom,
man?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit o’ it,” retorted Souter energetically,
jumping lightly to his feet. “Will I stand on my
head for ye, Mary, eh?”</p>

<p>Mary laughed merrily as Mrs. Burns replied in
scathing tones, “Your brains are in your boots, noo,
Souter Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Weel, wherever they are,” responded Souter with
a quizzical smile, “they dinna’ trouble me o’er much.
Weel, I think I’ll be turnin’ in noo,” he continued,
stretching himself lazily. “Good-night to ye all,”
and taking a candle from the dresser, he slowly left
the room.</p>

<p>“Come, lads,’tis bedtime,” admonished Mrs.
Burns, glancing at the old high clock that stood in
the corner. “Mary, ye shall sleep with me, and,
Robert, ye know where to find your bed. It hasna’
been slept in since ye left. Dinna’ forget your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
candle, Gilbert,” she called out as he started for the
door. He silently took it from her hand. “Dinna’
forget your promise,” she whispered anxiously to him
as he left the room in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>The look on his face frightened her. There was
bitterness and despair in the quick glance he gave
the happy lovers, who were standing in the shadow
of the deep window. “The lad looked fair heart-broken,”
she mused sorrowfully. For a moment she
looked after him, a puzzled frown on her brow.
Then suddenly the truth dawned on her. How blind
she had been, why hadn’t she thought of that before?
The lad was in love. In love with Mary Campbell,
that was the cause of his bitterness toward his
brother. “Both in love with the same lass,” she
murmured apprehensively, and visions of petty meannesses,
bitter discords, between the two brothers,
jealous quarrels, resulting in bloody strife, perhaps;
and she shuddered at the mental picture her uneasy
mind had conjured up. The sooner Robert and
Mary were married the sooner peace would be
restored, she thought resolutely. They could start
out for themselves, go to Auld Ayr or to Dumfries.
They couldn’t be much worse off there than here.
And determined to set her mind easy before she retired,
she walked briskly toward the couple, who now
sat hand in hand, oblivious to earthly surroundings,
the soft moonlight streaming full upon their happy
upturned faces. She watched them a moment in silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
loath to break in upon their sweet communion.
Presently she spoke.</p>

<p>“Robert,” she called softly, “ye’d better gang to
your bed noo, lad.”</p>

<p>With a start he came back to earth, and jumping
up boyishly, replied with a happy laugh, “I forgot,
mother, that I was keeping ye and Mary from your
rest.” He glanced toward the recessed bed in the
wall where his mother was wont to sleep. “Good-night,
mither, good-night, Mary,” he said lovingly.
Then taking his candle, he started for the door, but
turned as his mother called his name and looked at
her questioningly.</p>

<p>“Laddie, dinna’ think I’m meddling in your affairs,”
she said hesitatingly, “but I’m fair curious
to know when ye an’ Mary will be wed.”</p>

<p>Robert looked inquiringly at Mary, who blushed
and dropped her head. “Before harvest begins,
mither,” he answered hopefully, “if Mary will be
ready and willing. Will that suit ye, lassie?” And
he looked tenderly at the drooping head, covered with
its wealth of soft, glittering curls.</p>

<p>“I hae all my linen spun and woven,” she faltered,
after a nervous silence, not daring to look at him.
“Ye ken the lassies often came a rockin’ and so helped
me get it done.” She raised her head and looked in
his glowing face. “’Tis a very small dowry I’ll be
bringin’ ye, laddie,” she added in pathetic earnestness.</p>

<p>He gave a little contented laugh. “Ye’re bringin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
me yoursel’, dearie,” he murmured tenderly.
“What mair could any lad want. I ken I do not
deserve such a bonnie sweet sonsie lassie for my wife.”
He looked away thoughtfully for a moment. Then
he continued with glowing eyes, “But ye mind the
verse o’ the song I gave ye before I went awa’?”
he said lovingly, taking her hand in his. His voice
trembled with feeling as he fervently recited the

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>Life at Mossgiel passed uneventfully and monotonously.
Robert had settled down with every appearance
of contentment to the homely duties of
the farmer, and Gilbert could find no fault with
the amount of labor done. Morning till night he
plowed and harrowed the rocky soil, without a
word of complaint, although the work was very hard
and laborious. Planting had now begun and his
tasks were materially lightened. He had ample
leisure to indulge in his favorite pastime; and that
he failed to take advantage of his opportunities for
rhyming was a mystery to Gilbert, and a source of
endless regret to Mary. But his mother could tell of
the many nights she had seen the candle light gleaming
far into the night; and her heart was sore
troubled when in the morning she would see the evidence
of his midnight toil, scraps of closely written
paper scattered in wild disorder over his small table,
but she held her peace. The lad loved to do it, she
mused tenderly, and so long as he was not shirking his
work, why disturb his tranquillity?</p>

<p>A few weeks after the return of our hero Mary
and Mrs. Burns were seated in the living-room,
Mrs. Burns as usual busy at her wheel, while Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sat sewing at the window, where she could look out
across the fields and see her sweetheart, who, with
a white sheet containing his seed corn slung across
his shoulder, was scattering the grain in the earth.
She sang dreamily as she sewed, her sweet face beaming
with love and happiness. No presentiment
warned her of the approaching tragedy that was
soon to cast its blighting shadow over that happy
household—a tragedy that was inevitable. The
guilty one had sown to the flesh, he must reap corruption.
The seed had been sown carelessly, recklessly,
and now the harvest time had come, and such a harvest!
The pity of it was that the grim reaper must
with his devouring sickle ruthlessly cut down such a
tender, sweet, and innocent flower as she who sat
there so happy and so blissfully unconscious of her
impending doom.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with an exclamation of astonishment, she
jumped excitedly to her feet. “Mistress Burns,”
she cried breathlessly, “here are grand lookin’
strangers comin’ up the path. City folk, too, I
ken. Look.”</p>

<p>Hastily the good dame ran to the window. “Sure
as death, Mary; they’re comin’ here,” she cried in
amazement. “Oh, lack a day, an’ I’m na dressed
to receive the gentry.” A look of comical dismay
clouded her anxious face as she hurriedly adjusted
her cap and smoothed out her apron. “Is my cap
on straight, Mary?” she nervously inquired. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nodded her head reassuringly. “Oh, dear, whatever
can they want?” Steps sounded without. “Ye
open the door, Mary,” she whispered sibilantly as
the peremptory knock sounded loudly through the
room. Timidly Mary approached the door. “Hist,
wait,” called Mrs. Burns in sudden alarm. “My ’kerchief
isna’ pinned.” Hastily she pinned the loose end
in place, then folding her hands, she said firmly, “Noo
let them enter.” Mary slowly opened the door, which,
swinging inward, concealed her from the three
strangers, who entered with ill-concealed impatience
on the part of the two ladies who were being laughingly
chided by their handsome escort. With a
wondering look of admiration at the richly dressed
visitors, Mary quietly stole out and softly shut the
door behind her.</p>

<p>With a murmur of disgust the younger of the two
ladies, who was about nineteen, walked to the fireplace,
and raising her quilted blue petticoat, which
showed beneath the pale pink overdress with its Watteau
plait, she daintily held her foot to the blaze.
A disfiguring frown marred the dark beauty of
her face as her bold black eyes gazed about her
impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s a monstrous shame,” she flashed angrily,
“to have an accident happen within a few miles of
home. Will it delay us long, think you?” she
inquired anxiously, addressing her companion.</p>

<p>“It depends on the skill of the driver to repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the injury,” replied the other lady indifferently.
She appeared the elder of the two by some few years,
and was evidently a lady of rank and fashion. She
looked distinctly regal and commanding in her large
Gainsborough hat tilted on one side of her elaborately
dressed court wig. A look of amused curiosity
came over her patrician face as she calmly surveyed
the interior of the cottage. She inclined her head
graciously to Mrs. Burns, who with a deep courtesy
stood waiting their pleasure.</p>

<p>“We have just met with an accident, guidwife,”
laughingly said the gentleman, who stood in the
doorway brushing the dust from his long black
cloak. He was a scholarly looking man of middle
age, dressed in the height of taste and fashion.
“While crossing the old bridge yonder,” he continued,
smiling courteously at Mrs. Burns, “our
coach had the misfortune to cast a wheel, spilling us
all willy-nilly, on the ground, and we must crave
your hospitality, guidwife.”</p>

<p>“Ye are a’ welcome,” quickly answered Mrs.
Burns with another courtesy. “Sit doon, please,”
and she placed a chair for the lady, who languidly
seated herself thereon with a low murmur of thanks.</p>

<p>“Allow me to introduce myself,” continued the
gentleman, coming into the room, his cloak over
his arm. “I am Lord Glencairn of Edinburgh.
This is Lady Glencairn, and yonder lady is Mistress
Jean Armour of Mauchline.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The young lady in question, who was still standing
by the fireplace, flashed him a look of decided
annoyance. She seemed greatly perturbed at the
enforced delay of the journey. She started violently
as she heard Mrs. Burns say, “And I am
Mrs. Burns, your lordship.” Then she hurried to
the old lady’s side, a startled look in her flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Mistress Burns of Mossgiel Farm?” she inquired
in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” replied Mrs. Burns. The young
lady’s face went white as she walked nervously back
to the fireplace.</p>

<p>“My dear Jean, whatever is the matter?” asked
Lady Glencairn lazily, as she noticed Jean’s perturbation.
“Is there anything in the name of Burns to
frighten you?”</p>

<p>“No, your ladyship,” replied Jean falteringly,
turning her face away so that her large Gainsborough
hat completely shielded her quivering features.
“I—I am still a trifle nervous from the
upset, that is all.” She seemed strangely agitated.</p>

<p>“Was it not unlucky?” replied Lady Glencairn
in her rich vibrating contralto. “’Twill be a most
wearisome wait, I fear, but we simply must endure it
with the best possible grace,” and she unfastened her
long cloak of black velvet and threw it off her
shoulders, revealing her matchless form in its tightly
fitting gown of amber satin, with all its alluring
lines and sinuous curves, to the utmost advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“It willna’ be long noo, your ladyship,” replied
Mrs. Burns, smiling complacently. She had quietly
left the room while the two were talking, and seeing
Souter hovering anxiously around, trying to
summon up courage to enter, she had commanded
him to go to the fields and tell the lads of the accident,
which he had reluctantly done.</p>

<p>“My lads will soon fix it for ye,” she continued
proudly. “Robert is a very handy lad, ye ken. He
is my eldest son, who has just returned from Mauchline,”
she explained loquaciously in answer to Lord
Glencairn’s questioning look.</p>

<p>Jean nervously clutched at the neck of her gown,
her face alternately flushing and paling. “Your
son is here now?” she asked eagerly, turning to Mrs.
Burns.</p>

<p>“Aye, he’s out yonder in the fields,” she answered
simply.</p>

<p>“Oh, then you know the young man?” interrogated
Lady Glencairn, glancing sharply at Jean.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him,” she answered with averted
gaze. “We met occasionally in Mauchline at dancing
school, where we fell acquainted.”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn looked at her with half-closed eyes
for a moment, then she smilingly said, “And I’ll
wager your love for coquetting prompted you
to make a conquest of the innocent rustic, eh,
Jean?”</p>

<p>Jean tossed her head angrily and walked to the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lady Glencairn, you are pleased to jest,” she retorted
haughtily.</p>

<p>“There, there, Jean, you’re over prudish. I vow
’twould be no crime,” her ladyship calmly returned.
“I’ll wager this young farmer was a gay Lothario
while in Mauchline,” she continued mockingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, your ladyship,” interrupted Mrs. Burns
simply. “He was a flax dresser.”</p>

<p>“Truly a more respectable occupation, madame,”
gravely responded Lord Glencairn with a suspicious
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, my lord,” answered Mrs. Burns with
a deep courtesy. “My lad is a good lad, if I do say
so, and he has returned to us as pure minded as when
he went awa’ a year ago.”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn raised her delicately arched eyebrows
in amused surprise. Turning to Jean, she
murmured drily, “And away from home a year, too!
He must be a model of virtue, truly.”</p>

<p>Jean gazed at her with startled eyes. “Can she
suspect aught?” she asked herself fearfully.</p>

<p>“Could I be getting ye a cup of milk?” asked Mrs.
Burns hospitably. “’Tis a’ I have to offer, but
’tis cool and refreshing.”</p>

<p>“Fresh milk,” repeated Lady Glencairn, rising
with delight. “I vow it would be most welcome, guidwife.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would,” responded her husband. And
Mrs. Burns with a gratified smile hurried from the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear, don’t look so tragic,” drawled Lady
Glencairn carelessly, as she noticed Jean’s pale face
and frightened eyes. “We’ll soon be in Mauchline.
Although why you are in such a monstrous
hurry to reach that lonesome village after your delightful
sojourn in the capital, is more than I can
conjecture,” and her keen eyes noted with wonder
the flush mount quickly to the girl’s cheek.</p>

<p>“It is two months since I left my home, your ladyship,”
faltered Jean hesitatingly. “It’s only natural
I should be anxious to see my dear parents
again.” She dropped her eyes quickly before her
ladyship’s penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>“Dear parents, indeed,” sniffed Lady Glencairn to
herself suspiciously as she followed their hostess to
the door of the “ben.”</p>

<p>With a nervous little laugh Jean rose quickly from
her chair by the window and walked toward the door
through which they had entered. “The accident has
quite upset me, Lady Glencairn,” she said constrainedly.
“Would you mind if I stroll about the fields
until my nerves are settled?” she asked with a forced
laugh.</p>

<p>“No, child, go by all means,” replied her ladyship
indolently. “The air will do you good, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>“I warn you not to wander too far from the
house,” interposed Lord Glencairn with a kindly
smile. “We will not be detained much longer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
With a smile of thanks she hastily left the room just
as Mrs. Burns entered from the “ben” bearing a
large blue pitcher filled with foaming milk, which she
placed on the table before her smiling visitors.</p>

<p>Jean breathed a sigh of relief as she closed the
door behind her. She felt in another moment she
would have screamed aloud in her nervousness. That
fate should have brought her to the very home of
the man she had thought still in Mauchline, and to
see whom she had hurriedly left Edinburgh, filled
her with wonder and dread. “I must see him before
we leave,” she said nervously, clasping and unclasping
her hands. But where should she find him? She
walked quickly down the path and gazed across the
fields, where in the distance she could see several men
at work, repairing the disabled coach. Anxiously
she strained her eyes to see if the one she sought
was among them, but he was not there. Quickly she
retraced her steps. “I must find him. I must speak
with him this day,” she said determinedly. As she
neared the cottage she turned aside and walked toward
the high stone fence which enclosed the house
and yard. Swiftly mounting the old stile, she looked
about her. Suddenly she gave a sharp little exclamation,
and her heart bounded violently, for there before
her, coming across the field, was the man she sought,
his hands clasped behind him, his head bent low in the
deepest meditation. With a sigh of relief she sank
down on the step and calmly awaited his approach.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>Robert flung the last of his seed corn into the earth
with a sigh of thankfulness, for though he gave the
powers of his body to the labors of the farm, he refused
to bestow on them his thoughts or his cares.
He longed to seek the quiet of his attic room, for his
soul was bursting with song and his nervous fingers
fairly itched to grasp his pencil and catch and hold
forever the pearls dropped from the lap of the Goddess
Muse into his worshipful soul, ere they faded and
dissolved into lusterless fragments. Mechanically he
turned his footsteps toward the cottage, plunged in
deep reverie. As he walked slowly along his mind suddenly
reverted to the year he had spent in Mauchline.
It had been his first taste of town life. Blessed with
a strong appetite for sociability, although constitutionally
melancholy, and a hair-brained imagination,
he had become an immediate favorite and welcome
guest wherever he visited. <i>Vive l’amour</i> and <i>vive la
bagatelle</i> had soon become his sole principle of action.
His heart, which was completely tinder, was
eternally lighted up by some goddess or other, and it
was not long before he regarded illicit love with levity,
which two months previously he had thought of
with horror. Poesy was still a darling walk for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mind, but it was only indulged in according to the
humor of the hour. Having no aim in life he had been
easily led from the paths of virtue into many forms
of dissipation, which, when indulged in, afterwards
plunged him into the deepest melancholy. A few
months after his advent into the village he had met
Jean Armour, the daughter of a master builder.
She was one of the belles of Mauchline, a wild,
willful, imprudent lass, whose sensual charms soon
ensnared the susceptible heart of the unsophisticated
farmer lad. The fatal defect of his character
was the comparative weakness of his volition,
and his passions, once lighted up, soon carried him
down the stream of error and swept him over the
precipice he saw directly in his course.</p>

<p>Such being their temperaments, it was not to be
wondered at when their procedure soon became decidedly
irregular, their intimacy becoming the common
talk and gossip of Mauchline.</p>

<p>A few months before Robert returned to Mossgiel
farm Jean had received an invitation from her
god-parents, Lord and Lady Glencairn, to visit Edinburgh,
which she had accepted with eagerness, for she
was becoming tired of her latest conquest and longed
for the gay life of the capital.</p>

<p>Robert saw her leave Mauchline with no pangs of
regret at her inconstancy and caprice. He was in
a state of profound melancholy at the time, the
thoughts of how he had fallen from the paths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
truth and virtue, the thoughts of the pure love of
his sweetheart at home, filling his heart with grief
and remorse. He was thinking of all this as he
approached the stile. How wretchedly weak and
sinful he had been to forget his sworn vows to Mary,
he thought remorsefully. “May no harping voice
from that past ever come to disturb her peace of
mind,” he prayed fervently.</p>

<p>Jean watched him, drawing ever nearer, with eyes
filled with sudden shame and dread at what she had to
tell him. Why had her brief infatuation for the poverty-stricken
farmer led her into such depths of imprudence
and recklessness? she thought angrily. As
he reached the bottom of the stile she softly spoke
his name, and noted with chagrin his startled look of
surprise and annoyance as he raised his eyes to hers.</p>

<p>“Jean Armour?” he cried in amazement.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad to see me?” she asked coquettishly,
his presence exercising its old fascination for
her.</p>

<p>“What has brought ye to Mossgiel?” he asked
abruptly, ignoring her outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“An accident,” she replied flippantly. “I was
on my way home and would have been there ere this
had it not been for a fortunate mishap.”</p>

<p>“Fortunate mishap?” he repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she retorted amiably, “otherwise I should
have missed seeing you,” and she smiled down into
his pale startled face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dinna understand why ye left Edinburgh,” he
began, when she interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Because I thought you were still in Mauchline,”
she explained quickly. He look at her questioningly.
“I left Edinburgh for the sole purpose of seeing you,
Robert,” she announced quietly, making room for him
to sit beside her, but he did not accept the invitation.</p>

<p>“Well, noo, that was very kind of ye, Jean,” he
replied a little uneasily. “But I’m not so conceited
as to believe that. I ken the charms o’ Edinburgh
town, with its handsome officers, soon made ye forget
the quiet country village, and a’ your old flames,
including your bashful humble servant,” and he
made her a mocking bow.</p>

<p>His tone of satirical raillery made her wince.
“Forget?” she cried passionately, jumping to her
feet. “I wish to heaven I might forget everything,
but I cannot—I cannot.” The sudden thought of
her predicament caused her haughty, rebellious spirit
to quail, and covering her face with her hands, she
burst into a paroxysm of tears and sank heavily down
upon the step.</p>

<p>He regarded the weeping woman silently. Was
her attachment for him stronger than he had believed?
Could it be possible she still entertained a passion for
him? he asked himself anxiously. But no, that couldn’t
be; she had left him two months ago with a careless
word of farewell on her laughing lips. Yet why
these tears, these wild words she had just uttered?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
A wave of pity for her swept over him as he realized,
if such were the case, that he must repulse her
advances gently but none the less firmly. He had
done with her forever when he said his last farewell.
There could be no raking over of the dead ashes.</p>

<p>Jean angrily wiped away her tears. She must not
give way to such weakness. She had an errand to
perform which would need all her courage. He was
evidently waiting for some explanation of her strange
behavior, she told herself with a vain effort to steel
her heart. Now was the time to tell him all, she
thought fearfully, peeking out from behind her small
linen ’kerchief, with which she was dabbing her eyes,
at his cold, wondering face. The sooner it was done
the sooner she would know what to expect at his
hands. How should she begin? After a long, nervous
pause she faltered out, “Have you forgotten
the past, Robert, and all that we were to each other?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Jean, I remember everything,” he answered
remorsefully. “But let us not speak of that noo,
please. Ye ken that is all ended between us forever.”
He turned away pale and trembling, for her presence,
her looks and words recalled many things he wanted
to forget, that shamed him to remember.</p>

<p>“Ended?” she repeated, an angry flush rising to
the roots of her black hair. She looked at him in
amazement. He, the poverty-stricken farmer, had
repulsed her, the belle of Mauchline? Could she have
heard aright? He who had always been at her beck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and call, two months ago her willing slave, could
it be that he was over his infatuation for her? She
had not thought of that possibility. She had expected
him to be humble, gratefully flattered by her
condescension in seeking him out. If he should
refuse the proposal she had come so far to make! she
thought in trepidation. “He must not refuse, he
shall not refuse,” and her face grew hard and set.
But perhaps he was piqued because she had left him
so unceremoniously two months ago, because she had
not written him. Her tense lips relaxed into a smile.
Oh, well, she would be nice to him now; she would
make him think she was breaking her heart for him,
work on his sympathy, then perhaps it would not be
necessary to confess her humiliating plight. No
farmer doomed to lifelong poverty would be averse
to winning the hand of the daughter of the rich
Squire Armour. These thoughts, running through
her mind, decided her next move, and with a fluttering
sigh she rose from her seat and descended the step.
She drew close to him and looking languishingly up
into his face, murmured, “Why should it be ended,
Robert? I love you just the same as I did in the
past,” and she threw her arms about his neck, clinging
to him passionately. “You do love me a little,
tell me you do.”</p>

<p>“Jean, ye must be daft,” he panted, vainly trying
to disengage himself from her embrace.</p>

<p>But she continued softly, alluringly, “Think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the old days, when I lay in your arms like this, Robbie.
Think of those happy hours we spent together
on the banks of the Doon. You were not cold to me
then. Oh, let us live them all over again. How
happy we will be. Kiss me, Rob,” and she lifted
her flushed, piquant face, her crimson lips pursed
temptingly, close to his. The warmth of her seductive
body, the white bare arms in their short sleeves,
which embraced his neck, the half-closed passionate
eyes gazing invitingly, languorously into his own,
fired his naturally ardent blood, making his senses to
reel from the contact. Slowly his arms, which had
been restraining her amorous embrace, tightened
their hold on her, drawing her closer and closer,
while the drops of sweat poured down his white,
yielding face, as with wild bloodshot eyes he battled
with the temptations which beset him so wantonly,
so dangerously. With a thrill of elation not unmixed
with desire she felt him yielding to her
embrace, and knew that she had won him again.
With a cooing cry of delight she was about to press
her warm lips to his, when suddenly a bird-like voice
singing in the distance arrested her impulse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh where and oh where is my Highland laddie gone?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">rang out the voice of the singer plaintively. With a
cry of brief and horror Robert tore the clinging arms
from about his neck and threw her madly from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
“What is the matter, Robert?” she cried fearfully,
looking at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“I think ye had better go noo, Jean,” he answered
harshly, not looking at her. “’Twill be best for us
both. Oh, how I despise my weakness, I had no
right, no right noo.” And there was an agony of
shame and remorse in his voice.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” she asked white with rage.
“That you are not free to do as you like?” He remained
silent a moment.</p>

<p>Then his face grew calm and peaceful. “The lass
whom ye hear singing is Mary Campbell, my betrothed
wife,” he answered simply. “We are to be
married when the plantin’ is done. We have been
sweethearts for years, and if I have in my weakness
forgotten my sworn vows to her, by God’s help I’ll
strive to be more faithful in the future.” His voice
vibrated with intense feeling as he made the resolution.
Then he continued softly and tenderly, “And
the love I bear my faithful Mary will never cease as
long as this crimson current flows within me.” A
mocking laugh greeted his words as he finished.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Robert Burns,” cried Jean threateningly,
“she shall never be your wife, for I
will——” But the angry words died suddenly on
her lips at an unlooked-for interruption.</p>

<p>“Jean, Jean,” called a lazy voice. Turning
quickly she saw with apprehension Lady Glencairn
standing in the open doorway of the cottage, beckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
leisurely to her. Had she heard her imprudent
words? she asked herself in terror. But no, that were
not possible. She had not raised her voice. For a
moment she hesitated, not knowing what to do.
Should she tell him the truth now? It would only
mean a hurriedly whispered word or two, but as she
looked at him standing there so proudly erect, the
angry, puzzled flush which her last hasty words had
occasioned still mantling his swarthy face, she felt
her courage slipping away from her. Why not wait
and write him? she temporized; that would be much
better than creating a scene now, with the sharp eye
of Lady Glencairn fastened upon them. Yes, she
would do that, she decided hastily. She turned calmly
and mounted the stile and without one backward
glance descended to the other side. “Are you coming?”
she asked indifferently over her shoulder, and
without waiting for his answer walked quickly toward
the house. Robert after a moment’s indecision
gravely followed her, the look of puzzled concern
still wrinkling his forehead.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn’t know you were
indulging in a tête-à-tête,” said Lady Glencairn
frigidly as they reached the door.</p>

<p>“Lady Glencairn, this is Mr. Robert Burns,” stammered
Jean nervously, with a flush of embarrassment
at her ladyship’s sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, delighted I’m sure,” said her ladyship,
with a careless nod, which changed to surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
interest as Robert with simple, manly dignity removed
his Tam O’Shanter and bowed low before the
haughty beauty. “What an air for a peasant,” she
mused. “What dignity,” and she surveyed him
critically from the top of his head, with its black
clustering locks which gleamed purple in the sunshine,
to the tip of his rough leather brogans;
noting with admiration his stalwart frame, the well-shaped
head and massive neck, the strength suggested
in the broad shoulders, the deep chest, the
herculean limbs with the swelling muscles displayed
to such advantage within the tightly fitting breeches
of doe skin. “What a handsome creature,” she
thought with a thrill of admiration, as she took the
mental inventory of his good points. “And decidedly
interesting, I’ll wager, if not dangerous,” she
added, smiling contemplatively as she caught the look
of respectful admiration which gleamed in his wonderfully
magnetic eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, James,” she called languidly reëntering the
room, “here is the young man who has so kindly
assisted in repairing the coach—the young man who
has just returned from Mauchline,” she added significantly.</p>

<p>“Nay, your ladyship, ’tis my brother Gilbert you
must thank for his assistance, not me,” replied Robert,
flushing. As the deep tones of his sonorous voice
fell on her ear she felt an indefinable thrill of emotion
steal over her that startled her. She looked at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wonderingly. What peculiar magnetism was there in
this farmer’s voice that could so easily move her, who
had always prided herself on her coldness, her indifference
to all men, including her husband, who was
blissfully unconscious of his beautiful wife’s sentiments
regarding him?</p>

<p>“Your brother had no easy task, I fear, Mr.
Burns,” remarked Lord Glencairn genially. Then he
turned smilingly to Jean, who was standing impatiently
in the doorway. “What have you been doing
all this time, my dear Jean?” he asked lightly.</p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Burns,” insinuated Lady Glencairn
with an odd little smile at Jean’s embarrassed
countenance. He looked inquiringly at the surprised
face of the young farmer.</p>

<p>“Miss Armour has done me the honor of listening
to some of my rhyming,” quietly replied Robert with
a quick glance at Jean, his ready wit coming to her
rescue.</p>

<p>“So then you are a poet,” murmured Lady Glencairn,
with a smile. “Do you write love sonnets to
your sweethearts, or does the muse incline at this season
to songs of springtime?”</p>

<p>“Aye, my lady, he has the gift indeed,” spoke up
Mrs. Burns deprecatingly. “But I dinna’ ken if
it amounts to aught.”</p>

<p>“My mother doesna’ care for my poetry,” said
Robert simply, turning to her ladyship.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ say that, laddie,” replied his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
earnestly. “Ye ken I’m o’er fond of those verses
to Highland Mary, but——”</p>

<p>“‘Highland Mary’? what a dear name,” interrupted
Lady Glencairn sweetly, smiling at Robert.
“Who is she, may I ask?” and she leaned forward
questioningly in her chair.</p>

<p>“She is a—a friend,” he replied, flushing to the
roots of his hair. Then he continued, softly, his eyes
lighting up with love and devotion, “An’ she is as
sweet and fragrant as a sprig of pure white heather
plucked from her native Highlands.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and she’ll make a fine wife for Robert,”
added Mrs. Burns complacently.</p>

<p>“Aye, finer than I deserve, mither,” he replied,
looking uneasily at Jean, who had started violently,
then quickly leaned back against the door post, pale
and trembling.</p>

<p>“Marry her? Never! He cannot, he must not,”
she muttered to herself, frantically.</p>

<p>“Why, Jean!” cried Lady Glencairn, going to her
in sudden alarm. “What ails you, why do you look
so wild?”</p>

<p>“I—I’m—a pain gripped my heart most suddenly,”
she faltered. “I find it over warm here,”
she gasped. “I’ll await you without,” and she left
the room, a strange, frightened look on her pale
face.</p>

<p>With a puzzled frown Lady Glencairn turned and
sank thoughtfully into a chair. Looking up suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
she caught Robert’s eye fastened upon her
face in eager scrutiny. “Let me see, what were we
speaking about?” she inquired indifferently.</p>

<p>“Ye were kind enough to ask me about my
poetry,” answered Rob quietly. Jean’s queer behavior
troubled him. What did it all mean? He
feared she had aroused suspicion in her ladyship’s
mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure, and I vow I’m curious,” she replied
brightly. “I should like to read one of your
poems, Mr. Burns, if you have one at hand.”</p>

<p>“He has bushels of them in the attic, your ladyship,”
eagerly spoke Mrs. Burns.</p>

<p>“Aye, mother,” laughed Robert, “all waiting for
the publisher. Here is one I but this day scribbled
off, if—if ye really care to read it,” he added
bashfully, taking a scrap of paper from the pocket
of his loose shirt and handing it to Lady Glencairn.</p>

<p>She took it with a smile of amused indifference.
A farmer and a poet! the idea was absurd. With an
almost imperceptibly sarcastic lifting of her delicate
eyebrows she read the title, “‘Flow gently, sweet
Afton, among thy green braes.’” Then she read the
verse in growing wonder and astonishment. She had
thought to please him with a word of praise, even if
they were laughably commonplace and prosaic; but it
was with genuine enthusiasm that she heartily cried,
“Really, ’tis a gem, Mr. Burns, so charming withal,
such beautiful sentiment, and writ in most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
style. Read it, James,” and she handed it to Lord
Glencairn, who carefully perused it with apparent
delight in its rhythmic beauty of composition.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, my lady,” replied Robert, flushing.
“Your praise is o’er sweet to my hungry ear.” She
gazed at him in open admiration.</p>

<p>“Here, Robert, are some more,” cried Mrs. Burns,
entering the room with a box, which she placed
before her son. “Show his lordship these, laddie,”
and she hovered nervously around, her face flushed
with excitement, watching anxiously every look and
expression that passed over the faces of their guests.</p>

<p>Robert opened the box and selected a few of the
poems at random, which he handed to Lord Glencairn
without a word.</p>

<p>“‘A man’s a man for a’ that,’ ‘Willie brewed
a peck of malt,’ ‘Holy Willie’s Prayer,’ ‘The Lass
of Balbehmyle,’” read Lord Glencairn slowly,
glancing over their titles. Then he read them
through earnestly, his noble face expressing the interest
he felt; then with a sigh of pleasure he passed
them to Lady Glencairn, who devoured the written
pages eagerly, her face flushed and radiant. When
she had finished, she leaned back in her chair and fixed
her luminous eyes upon her husband’s beaming face.</p>

<p>“James,” said she decidedly, “you will please me
well if you will influence some publisher to accept this
young man’s poems and place them before the public.
I’m sure he is most deserving, and—he interests me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
greatly.” There was a peculiar glitter in her half-closed
eyes as she gazed intently at Robert with an
enigmatic smile parting her red lips. The gracious
lady with her high-bred air, her alluring smile, her
extreme condescension, was a revelation to the country-bred
lad, who was brought in close contact for the
first time with one so far above his station in life.
He felt his awkwardness more than he had ever
thought possible as he felt her critical eyes fastened
upon him and heard her honeyed words of praise and
encouragement.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burns,” said his lordship earnestly,
“your poems interest me greatly, and I declare such
genius as you display should be given an opportunity
to develop. It will afford me much pleasure to take
these verses, with your permission, back with me to
Edinburgh and submit them to Sir William Creech,
who is the largest publisher there, and a personal
friend of mine, and if he accepts these poems as a
criterion of your artistic ability, without the least
doubt your success will be at once assured.” He put
them carefully in the large wallet he had taken from
an inside pocket while he was talking, and replaced it
within his coat.</p>

<p>Robert looked at him, hardly daring to believe his
ears. “I—I canna find words to express my unbounded
gratitude to you, my lord,” he faltered, his
voice low and shaking.</p>

<p>“I’d advise you to make a collection of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
poems, my lad,” continued Lord Glencairn quietly,
touched by the sight of Robert’s expressive features,
which he was vainly trying to control. “Chiefly
those in the Scottish dialect; they are new and will
create a sensation. Have them ready to forward
to town when sent for.” There was a tense silence
for a moment when he had finished.</p>

<p>Robert dared not trust his voice to speak, to
utter his thanks. Finally he burst out. “My
lord, how can I ever thank ye for this unlooked-for
generosity to an absolute stranger!” he cried
brokenly. “For years I have been praying for a
publisher to edit my songs, but I could see no silver
lining to the dark clouds of obscurity hanging over
my unhappy, friendless head, clouds which threatened
to engulf me in their maddening embrace.
But now,” he continued eloquently, his voice ringing
with gladness, “the bright sunlight is peeping
around the fast disappearing cloud, warming my
very soul with its joyous rays. Oh, my lord, if
ever the name of Robert Burns should e’en become
familiar to his countrymen,’twill be through your
graciousness, your benevolence, to a poor unknown,
humble plowman,” and his eyes filled with tears of
love and gratitude for his noble benefactor.</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn took a pinch of snuff from the
small oblong box he held in his hand, and used his
handkerchief vigorously to conceal the tears of sympathy
which had welled up in his eyes as he listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the recital of Robert’s ambitions, his hopes and
fears.</p>

<p>“My dear lad,” he said, trying to speak lightly,
“I have done nothing as yet to deserve such fulsome
words of thanks. ’Tis but a trifling thing I
propose doing, and it pleases me, else perhaps I
might not trouble myself to speak in your behalf.”</p>

<p>“Ah, noo, sir,” cried Mrs. Burns, wiping away
the tears of joy, “’tis your big, noble heart which
prompts ye to assist a struggling genius to something
better, higher, and nobler in this life. God
bless ye for it.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and Gilbert Burns quietly
entered the room. Removing his Tam O’Shanter, he
bowed respectfully to Lord Glencairn and said
briefly, “Your Lordship’s coach is repaired.”</p>

<p>With a word of thanks Lord Glencairn rose and
assisted his wife into her cloak.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness we can proceed on our journey
while it is yet light,” she said animatedly, going to
the door.</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mistress Burns, we have enjoyed
your hospitality amazing well,” said Lord Glencairn,
turning to their hostess. “Believe me, we’ll not forget
it.”</p>

<p>They left the house, followed by their admiring
hosts. Suddenly Lady Glencairn gave a little cry
of delighted surprise as her eyes rested on the drooping
figure of Highland Mary, sitting disconsolately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
on a large rock beside the old well. “What a sweet,
pretty flower of a lass!” she cried enthusiastically.
“Come here, child,” she called aloud. Mary looked
up quickly with a little gasp of surprise, for she had
not noticed them come out. She rose bashfully to her
feet and stood hesitating, her eyes timidly fixed on a
piece of heather she was holding in her hand.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn laughed amusedly. “I vow ’tis
an uncommon modest shy wildflower truly,” she said
to her husband. “Come here, child, I’ll not bite you,”
and she held out her hands toward the wondering
girl.</p>

<p>With a little silvery, timid laugh Mary walked
quickly toward her. “I’m no afraid, my lady,” she
replied quietly, but her heart was beating very fast,
nevertheless, as she stood before the great lady, who
was watching the flower-like face, with the delicate
pink color coming and going, with such apparent
admiration.</p>

<p>“That’s our Highland Mary,” triumphantly
cried Souter, who had just come upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” replied her ladyship brightly. “So
you are Highland Mary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” answered Mary with a quaint
little courtesy.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a dear,” said Lady Glencairn aloud to
her husband.</p>

<p>She turned to Robert, who was proudly watching
Mary, with eyes aglow with love and happiness. “No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wonder, Mr. Burns,” she said, a sigh involuntarily
escaping her as she noted his rapt gaze, “that you
have sought to portray in song and verse the sweet
loveliness of this fair maiden.” Then she turned
suddenly to Mary.</p>

<p>“You’re a very pretty child,” she said carelessly.
“But I suppose you know that well ere this.” She
laughed cynically and turned away.</p>

<p>“She isna used to such compliments, your ladyship,”
said Robert, noticing the embarrassed blush
that mounted to Mary’s cheek. “She’s o’er shy, ye
ken.”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind we raise in the Highlands,”
declared Souter with a satisfied air.</p>

<p>“Come, James, it grows late,” wearily said Lady
Glencairn, taking her husband’s arm. “And here is
the coach.” As the vehicle with its prancing black
horses champing restlessly at their bits drew up to
the gate, she turned to Mary and said condescendingly,
“Good-by, child; I suppose some day, when Mr.
Burns is the Bard of Scotland, we’ll see you in town
with him. Be sure to come and see me at Glencairn
Hall.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, my lady,” replied Mary, courtesying
deeply, fortunately not discerning the sarcasm in the
tired tones of the great lady’s voice.</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn helped her into the coach, and
then turned to Robert with outstretched hand. “My
lad,” he said cordially, “you may expect to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
from me or Sir William Creech very shortly.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, sir,” replied Robert, “and may Heaven
bless you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lud,” cried Lady Glencairn as they were
about to start, “we’re forgetting Jean.”</p>

<p>“The young lady strolled alang,” answered Gilbert
quietly. “She said you would overtake her on
the road.”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn thanked him with a careless nod,
and then leaned far out of the door to Robert. “Remember,
Mr. Burns,” she said softly, pressing his
hand, “I expect to see you in Edinburgh very soon,
don’t forget,” and with another lingering look, full
of meaning, she withdrew into the coach, and soon
they were gone in a cloud of dust, while he stood there
gazing after them like one in a dream with the last
rays of the setting sun lighting up his dark, passionate
face.</p>

<p>“Hurra! ’tis luck ye’re in, laddie,” shouted
Souter in his ear. “The gentry have noticed ye.
Ye should be dancing for joy, mon. I’m off to tell
the lads of your good fortune,” and away he sped
to the village, eager as any old gossip to spread the
glorious news.</p>

<p>“Isna it all like a dream, Mary?” sighed Mrs.
Burns rapturously, leading the way into the house,
followed by the two lovers, who entered hand in hand
and seated themselves in blissful silence on the high-backed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
settle under the window, their favorite seat.
For a few moments they sat motionless, regarding
each other with moist eyes. It almost seemed too
good to be true. In a few weeks perhaps Robert
would be a great man, thought Mary proudly.
“Weel, I always did have faith in Robert’s poetry,”
suddenly declared Mrs. Burns with conviction.</p>

<p>Robert smiled at his mother’s words. “They
would all say that now,” he thought, but without
bitterness, for it was only the way of the world after
all.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll soon hae riches noo,” said Mary happily.</p>

<p>“Aye, then ye shall hae a fine new gown, and—and
we will be married noo, instead of waiting,” answered
Robert, taking her tenderly in his arms.</p>

<p>“’Tis a bonnie, bonnie pair ye make,” said Mrs.
Burns lovingly. “May God bless ye,” and she softly
stole away, leaving them to their feast of love.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>Jean left the house filled with terrified dismay. Robert
going to marry another? then what would
become of her? She would be disgraced and ruined.
The thought drove her frantic. “He shall not marry
her; he shall give me the protection of his name, for
the time being at least,” she said to herself angrily.
Afterward, the marriage could be easily annulled; she
did not want him. She did not want to be tied for life
to any farmer, not she. She would then return to
Edinburgh. But suppose he would not consent to
such an arrangement? Well she would scare him into
it. He was as much to blame as she was anyway.
She would not wait to write him after all; she would
tell him now. There was nothing to fear. She would
wait until the others had started, then come back and
force her claim. If they went on without her, it
did not matter much; it was not far to the Inn, she
mused determinedly. She stopped in her rapid walk
and retraced her steps. As she neared the cottage
the door opened and her god-parents came out, and
with them were Robert and the others. Before they
could perceive her, however, she slipped quickly behind
an old beech tree back of the well and nearest
the house. Breathlessly, impatiently, she waited while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they talked, and talked, till she thought they would
never go. Then when the coach came and the attendant
excitement of its departure, like a guilty
creature she stole noiselessly across the intervening
space to the cottage, slipped through the open door,
and hid herself behind the fireplace, where Mary had
concealed herself some weeks before.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Burns left the room Jean came boldly
out from her hiding place and stood before the
startled couple, who gazed at her in amazement. She
looked at them insolently, a sneer on her full lips.</p>

<p>“Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Burns,” she interrupted
sarcastically. The color slowly faded from
his ruddy face. Was she going to expose that
shameful page in his past history to this innocent
child? Would she dare, could she be so reckless, so
shameless? he asked himself fearfully.</p>

<p>“I thought ye had gone,” he said, dangerously
calm, stepping up to her.</p>

<p>“I could not go till I had delivered a message,”
she explained, dropping her eyes before the determined
light in his.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, puzzled by her tone and
manner.</p>

<p>“It is of great importance and for your ears
alone,” she replied glibly. “I’m sure this lady—Miss
Campbell, is it not?—will not mind leaving us
for a moment,” and she smiled amiably into Mary’s
innocent inquiring face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>He led Mary gently to the door. “It’ll be only
for a moment, Mary,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“I dinna’ mind,” she answered brightly. “’Tis
near time for me to be going hame, ye ken,” and with
a smile she left them together.</p>

<p>“Noo, then, what is your message?” he said with
calm abruptness, as the door closed.</p>

<p>“This!” and she threw back her head defiantly.
“You must give up this Mary Campbell.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement. “What do ye
mean?” he gasped, opening his eyes in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I mean you must make me your wife.” Her pale
and agitated face made him wonder if she had gone
quite daft. Before he could answer she continued
stridently, “You must marry me now, before it is
too late, too late to save my name from dishonor and
disgrace. Now do you understand?”</p>

<p>A look of incredulous horror slowly blanched his
face to ashy whiteness. Had he heard aright? Surely
she was jesting; it could not be possible—and yet,
why not? His haggard eyes searched her colorless
face as though he would read her very soul. Calmly
she bore the scrutiny and then, with a groan of
anguish, he sank into a chair, weak and trembling.
“I canna, I willna, believe,” he muttered hoarsely.
“It’s a lie, it’s a lie, Jean Armour!”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth, I tell you,” she cried passionately,
wringing her hands. “What else think you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
force me, the rich Belle of Mauchline, to humble my
pride and stoop to plead to a poverty-stricken farmer
to wed me?” She laughed wildly.</p>

<p>“Can it be true, can it be true?” he whispered to
himself dully. He felt dazed by the suddenness, the
total unexpectedness, of the blow. He closed his eyes
wearily. What was it she wanted him to do, he
could not think. He sat dumbly waiting for her to
speak again.</p>

<p>“You must write out an acknowledgment and
sign your name to it,” she continued, her voice low
and insistent. “It is an irregular marriage I know,
but it will save me from my father’s wrath, when I
can keep my plight from him no longer.” He still remained
silent, his face hidden in his hands. “Will
you do this?” she demanded anxiously, “or,” and
her voice grew hard and threatening, “or shall I
appeal to the Parish officers to help me save my good
name from disgrace?” Quickly he raised his head.
At his look of indignant scorn she winced and
turned away, flushing angrily.</p>

<p>With a mirthless little laugh he retorted with
bitter emphasis, “Your good name, indeed!”</p>

<p>She turned on him defiantly. “I was no worse
than other girls,” she flippantly retorted. “Only
more unfortunate. Will you do what I ask? Quick,
tell me, someone is coming!” She nervously caught
his hand. He did not speak. His face grew haggard
and old-looking as he stood motionless, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
his resolution. It seemed to her an eternity before
he answered her.</p>

<p>“So be it,” he answered hoarsely, drawing his hand
away from hers and moving slowly to the door. “I’ll
send ye the lines by the posty to-morrow.”</p>

<p>With a cry of delight she gratefully held out
her hand to him. But he quietly opened the door,
and, without a word or look at her, stood silently
holding it back, his head bowed low on his bosom, his
face cold and repellent. Slowly Jean walked past
him out into the deepening twilight. She felt a
dawning pity in her heart for the wretched lad. She
could not quite forget those old, happy days, those
stolen walks and trysts along the banks of the Ayr.
No one could make love so ardently as he, she
thought with a sigh. Of all her lovers he had been
the favorite, he was so ingenuous, so trustful and confiding,
and yet so reckless, so imprudent and weak.
She knew well he had never really loved her, and the
thought had made her strive all the harder to win him.
He was flattered by her open preference for him, and
soon became an easy victim, a slave, to her seductive
charms and sophisticated fascinations, for he was only
human. And now the heart of that little dairymaid
would be broken. A quick pang of shame and regret
stole over her, but she instantly stifled it. She must
think of self first, she told herself uneasily. Anyway
she only wanted the marriage lines in case people
should point an accusing finger at her. Later—well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the marriage could be annulled privately, and no one
be the wiser, for marriages were easily annulled in
Scotland. She walked briskly to where the coach was
standing, for they were waiting for her, determined
to cast all gloomy, depressing thoughts from her for
the time at least.</p>

<p>Robert mechanically closed the door behind her
and walked slowly to the dresser. Taking from it a
bottle of ink and a quill, he carried them to the table,
and placing them upon it, sank heavily in a chair.
Long he sat there, pen in hand, the victim of the
profoundest melancholy, the deepest despair. The
thought that it was his own fault, his indifference to
consequences, his recklessness, his weak, sinful folly,
that had plunged himself and others into the awful
abyss of grief and sorrow, was like the bitterness of
death to him. As he sat there with drawn and haggard
face, while bitter regret gnawed deeply at his
conscience, the plaintive tones of Mary’s voice came
through the window, singing softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ye banks and braes of bonnie Doon,</div>
<div class="verse">How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A groan of agony escaped the grief-stricken
man at the sound of the voice, which was sweeter than
all else in the world to him.</p>

<p>“Mary, my lost Highland Mary!” he cried aloud,
“how can I give ye up forever?” and throwing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
across the table he wept bitter tears of anguish
and remorse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“How can ye chant, ye little birds,</div>
<div class="verse">An’ I sae weary, fu’ o’ care?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">continued the sweet voice in mournful cadence.
Softly the words floated to the ears of the sorrowing
man, like the echo of his own harrowing thoughts.</p>

<p>As Mary reached the open window she paused
and gazed into the room eagerly. As she sees her
lover sitting there so silent and alone, her smile is
very sweet and tender.</p>

<p>“Dear laddie; asleep,” she whispers softly. “He
must be o’er tired after his hard day’s work. God
bless my laddie,” and with a smile of ineffable sweetness,
she wafted a kiss to the bowed head and quickly
passed on, wending her lonely way back to Castle
Montgomery, while the man sitting there in agonized
silence, with clenched teeth and tense muscles,
slowly raised his head to listen, in heart-broken silence,
to her sweet voice floating back to him in silvery
melody, as she took up the broken thread of her
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thou’lt break my heart, thou warbling bird,</div>
<div class="verse">That wantons thro’ the flow’ring thorn.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou minds me o’ departed joys,</div>
<div class="verse">Departed, never to return.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song died away in the distance.</p>

<p>“God pity her, God pity me,” he murmured
brokenly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p>From the huge, low ceilinged kitchen of Castle
Montgomery, which was ablaze with light, came the
gladsome sound of mirth and revelry, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Some merry countre folks togither did convene,</div>
<div class="verse">To burn their nits and pou’ their stocks, and hold their hallowe’en,</div>
<div class="verse">For blythe that night.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For miles around the annual invitations had been
sent broadcast, and to-night the capacious kitchen
was taxed to its utmost. It was, however, a singularly
good-natured, if over-hilarious, gathering that had
assembled to do justice to old Bess’s cooking, and to
test their fate through the medium of the many
charms so well known to all the peasantry.</p>

<p>There was Poosie Nancy in her stiffly-starched
frilled cap and her new kirtle, complacently nodding
here and there to all of her acquaintances as
they flocked about her. Poosie Nancy was a merry
old soul. For years she had been the mistress of the
Arms Inn, the public house on the high road, where
Souter and Tam O’Shanter were wont to idle away
their time and, incidentally, their “siller.” Standing
on one foot behind her was Molly Dunn. Molly was
consciously resplendent in a new plaid frock, made by
her own unskilled hands, and while it was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
not a thing of beauty, it surely was a joy forever, to
the lassies, who laughingly twitted her about her
handiwork. But she heeded not their good-natured
jibes. She was admiringly watching Daddy Auld,
the little old minister, who sat in the midst of an
admiring group of his parishioners at the other side
of the room, who evidently stood in no awe of him,
judging from the bursts of laughter which greeted his
frequent attempts at jocularity.</p>

<p>“Where is Tam O’Shanter, Souter Johnny?” suddenly
asked old Bess, who was proudly doing the
honors as mistress of ceremonies. Souter was
assiduously paying court to the comely Poosie Nancy
in the opposite corner with an eye to future possibilities.</p>

<p>“He willna be here till late,” he replied impatiently,
addressing the crowd. “I left him at the Arms Inn,
an’ if he drinks much mair whisky, he will na’ be here
at all, I’m thinkin’,” and he turned eagerly to his
inamorata, who was fanning herself indifferently with
a plantain leaf.</p>

<p>“He’ll fall into the Doon some night an’ be
drowned, sure as fate,” said she, carelessly dismissing
the subject.</p>

<p>“Take your partners for the reel!” shouted big
Malcolm Macræ stentoriously, at this juncture. Old
Donald tuned up his fiddle with gleeful alacrity.</p>

<p>Souter ceremoniously offered Poosie his arm,
which she condescendingly accepted, and majestically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
they walked to the middle of the floor. With
much laughing and joking and good-natured rivalry,
they were all quickly paired off, and soon the
rafters rang with the happy voices of the hilarious
dancers as they merrily sang to the tune that blind
Donald was scratching out on his old and faithful,
though unmelodious, fiddle.</p>

<p>Mary had taken no part in the merrymaking, for
she felt heavy and sad at heart. From her seat in
the corner, where the light was the dimmest, she had
watched the door with patient anxiety, hoping
against hope that Robert would come, but she had
waited in vain, and now the evening was nearly spent
and soon they would be going home, happy and tired
after their sport and entertainment, while she would
steal away to her quarters over the kitchen and cry
herself to sleep, as she had done for many nights
past. Souter Johnny, who was in his element and the
merriest of them all, had tried vainly to induce her to
join the revelers in their sport, and many an honest
laddie had sought her hand in the dance, only to
be shyly refused. So gradually she was left in peace,
and soon forgotten amid the excitement of their diversions.
They had tried some of the famous charms,
which decided the destinies of many of the lads and
lassies that night, and now old Bess brought forth
her long-hoarded bag of nuts, which she divided
among them. Amid shouts of mirth and laughter,
they proceeded to test the most famous of all the
charms. As they rushed pell-mell to the fireplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and laid each particular nut in the fire, for which
they had named the lad or lassie of their choice,
and stood there eagerly watching, open-mouthed, to
see how they would burn, Mary, with a quickly beating
heart, stole unperceived close to the front row of
watchers, and with a little prayer, quietly threw her
pair into the fire. For a moment they burned slowly
side by side, then with a hop and a jump they popped
madly about, and finally at opposite sides of the
fireplace they glowed redly for a time, then expired
altogether. With a little, suppressed sob, unheeded
in the general excitement, she hurried back to her
seat, pale and trembling. It was as she had feared:
the course of their love was never again to run
smoothly, the charm had spoken. It had never been
known to predict wrongly. Why had she sought to
find out her fate? she asked herself pathetically.
Unheeding the merry songs and dances going on
around her, of which they never seemed to weary, and
the unco tales and funny jokes, she sat there thinking
her sweet, sad thoughts, and patiently waiting till
they should depart for their homes, that she might
seek the quiet of her bed, where her aching heart
might find relief in the tears which nowadays were
so hard to control. Suddenly the laughter subsided,
and Mary with a start raised her head to see all eyes
turned on her.</p>

<p>“Mary, come here, lass,” called Souter Johnny,
who was fanning himself vigorously.</p>

<p>“It’s your turn noo, Mary,” they cried boisterously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“So gie us a dance or a song,” and they
all pressed around her with good-natured suggestions.</p>

<p>Old Bess took the shrinking girl by the hand, and
leading her forward, with a deep courtesy announced,
“Hieland Mary will favor us wi’ a song,”
then she left Mary standing in the center of the room
suffering agonies of dread as she raised her frightened
eyes to the group of laughing, good-natured,
gaping faces about her.</p>

<p>“I canna’ sing, I canna’ sing, Souter,” she faltered,
turning to him beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, ye can, dearie, just a—a verse, there’s a
girlie,” he answered encouragingly. “Come and
stand beside me, if that’s any inspiration to ye,” he
added, smiling good-humoredly.</p>

<p>She ran to his side, and clutching him by the arm,
tried to muster up her courage, for the good-natured
audience were clamorously demanding a song. With
a frightened little gasp she began to sing the first
thing that came to her mind. “Oh, where, and oh,
where is my Highland laddie gone?” she faltered
out. A little titter passed through the crowd, for
they knew that “Rab Burns was nae longer sweet
on Mary Campbell,” as they told each other in loud
whispers. At the cruel sound Mary, whose lips had
trembled ominously as she thought of her recreant
lover, with an indignant look at the thoughtless ones,
burst into a flood of tears. Quickly Souter led her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sobbing to a seat, while the others anxiously crowded
round, conscience-stricken at their thoughtless levity.</p>

<p>“What’s happent? what’s happent? Has she
fainted?” they asked in helpless confusion, gazing
from one to the other.</p>

<p>“She’s only a wee bittie tired,” answered old
Souter, tenderly smoothing the hair of the sorrowing
lass. “Let her alone an’ she’ll be all right.
Donald,” he called, “start your fiddle; we’re gang
to hae anither dance.”</p>

<p>The blind old patriarch smiled serenely, and raising
his fiddle to his chin began to play, and soon the
mirth and fun grew fast and furious as the dancers
reeled and set, and crosst and cleekit.</p>

<p>While old Donald was playing, and the dance was
well started, Souter quietly led Mary out in the open
air, and sitting down on the doorstep, he drew her
gently beside him. “Noo, Mary, what is the matter?”
he inquired kindly. “Winna ye tell old Souter
Johnny your trouble?”</p>

<p>“Ye ken why I am unhappy, Souter Johnny,”
answered Mary apathetically. He sighed and remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Have ye an’ Robert quarreled?” he asked
presently.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered sadly.</p>

<p>“Weel, come tell old Souter; it may ease your
mind, lassie,” and he drew her plaid about her
shoulders, for the night air was keen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, ye ken, Souter,” she faltered, a pitiful
little break in her voice, “Robbie an’ I were to be
married after the plantin’ was o’er, and ’tis noo
harvest time, but ne’er a word has he spoke of our
marriage since that day. He is so changed, Souter,
I—I canna understand him at all,” and she leaned
wearily against his shoulder like a tired child.</p>

<p>“That Armour lass is at the bottom of it all, I
ken,” thought Souter angrily, drawing her close to
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” continued Mary sadly, “perhaps he
has grown tired of his Highland Mary.” She plucked
idly at the fringe of her plaid, a look of resignation
on her sweet face.</p>

<p>“Tired o’ ye?” repeated Souter incredulously.
“A man would be a most fearful fool to gie up such
a bonnie, sweet lassie as ye are. Noo, if I were only
younger, Robbie Burns wouldna hae things all his
own way, I tell ye,” and he nodded his head vigorously.</p>

<p>“I ken he has some trouble,” said Mary, not heeding
his jocular efforts to cheer her, “that makes
him so unhappy like; if he would only let me share
that trouble wi’ him, whate’er it is, how gladly I
would do it.”</p>

<p>Souter rubbed his bearded chin reflectively.</p>

<p>“Weel, Mary, ye ken Robert’s a genius,” he
answered soberly. “An’ ye can ne’er tell how a
genius is gang to act, therefore ye must ne’er be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
surprised, Mary, at whate’er he does, for genius is
but anither name for eccentricity an’—an’ perverseness,”
and he sighed deeply, his kind old face wrinkled
with perplexity.</p>

<p>“I feel, Souter,” she continued, pathetically calm,
“that I am slowly, but surely, drifting out o’ his
life forever.” She gazed suddenly into the face bending
over her solicitously.</p>

<p>“Dinna ye know the cause, Souter?” she asked
beseechingly.</p>

<p>He brushed his hand across his eyes and slowly
shook his head. She sighed patiently and turned
away her head and gazed listlessly into space. For a
few moments there was deep silence, broken only
by the bursts of laughter which came to them at
intervals from within.</p>

<p>“Lassie, listen to me,” finally said the old man,
his voice cheery and hopeful once more. “Ye
mustna be so down-hearted; there is a cause for
everything in this world, an’ I ken Robert loves ye
wi’ all his heart, just the same as ever. Why, ye
can see the glimmer o’ love in his e’e whene’er he
looks at ye.” He smiled approvingly as Mary’s face
brightened, then continued decidedly, “Robert is well-nigh
daft that he hasna heard frae Lord Glencairn
all this time; that is why he is sae worrid an’ nervous,
sae moody an’ neglectful; noo cheer thee, lassie, it’ll
all come right in time,” and he patted her shoulder
lovingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I feel sae much better, Souter,” she murmured,
pressing his hand gratefully. “An’ noo I’ll
na borrow trouble any mair, thinkin’ Robert doesna’
love me.” She smiled happily and jumped lightly to
her feet.</p>

<p>“Whist, Mary, why dinna ye make sure o’ that?”
whispered Souter, looking around him mysteriously.
She looked at him wonderingly. “’Tis Hallowe’en,
ye ken, an’ a’ the witches an’ fairies are about this
night an’ will grant any wish made. Try a charm,
lassie.”</p>

<p>“I did try one,” replied Mary with a sigh. “I
burned the nuts, but it didna’ come out right; that’s
what made me sad.”</p>

<p>“Ah, weel, try anither; go pull a stock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nay, I’m afraid to go out in the field at
night,” she replied timidly, drawing back. “But
I’ll go if ye’ll come wi’ me.” She held out her hand
to him.</p>

<p>“Nay, thank ye, Mary,” he said grimly. “I
dinna’ care to see the face o’ my future wife just
yet; I fear I couldna’ stand the shock.”</p>

<p>“Well, I darena’ go alone,” answered Mary decidedly,
her hand on the latch. “Think of anither
charm, one I can do indoors.”</p>

<p>“An’ do ye think the fairies will come around
where ’tis light?” he cried in amazement. “Och,
no, ye must go to the darkest place ye can find.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
His little round eyes gazed into hers with solemn
earnestness.</p>

<p>Mary shivered with apprehension and peered into
the darkness. “Oh, Souter, think o’ the witches,”
she said nervously.</p>

<p>“They willna’ hurt ye,” he answered a little impatiently.
“Ye maun sow a handful of hempseed
an’ harrow it o’er wi’ anything ye can draw after
ye, an’ repeat o’er and o’er,” assuming a guttural
monotone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Hempseed, I sow thee; hempseed, I sow thee,</div>
<div class="verse">And him that is to be my true love,</div>
<div class="verse">Come after me and draw thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And will I see him then?” whispered Mary
eagerly, drawing near to him.</p>

<p>“Aye,” returned Souter hoarsely. “Look over
your left shoulder an’ ye’ll see your future husband
pullin’ hemp. Noo, off wi’ ye; ye’ll find some
seed in the barn.” Mary tried to summon up her
courage, for she was highly superstitious, like all the
peasantry, and was anxious to test the potency of
the charm, and finally succeeded in taking a few
faltering footsteps in the direction of the barn,
when suddenly the door behind them opened, and
Molly Dunn appeared in the doorway. She held in
one hand a lighted candle, while in the other she carried
a broken piece of looking-glass, into which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was gazing intently, her eyes fixed and staring.
Behind her, crowding through the doorway, followed
the now noiseless revelers, who were stifling their
laughter to breathlessly watch the outcome of the
well-known charm, whose power Molly had decided
to put to a test, though believing staunchly in its
potency. Molly majestically walked down the steps
and across to the well, where, depositing her mirror
on the curbing, she took from the pocket of her
skirt a round, red apple, from which she bit a
goodly piece and began vigorously to chew upon it,
the while holding her candle above her head and anxiously
watching her reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Molly’s eatin’ the apple at the glass,” chuckled
Souter to Mary softly. “She’s lookin’ for the face
o’ her future husband. Let’s hae some fun wi’ her.”
He motioned to them all to keep silent, and stealing
softly over to the unconscious Molly, intoned in a
deep sepulchral voice, “Molly Dunn, if ye would see
your future husband, dinna’ ye dare turn your head
this way.”</p>

<p>Molly gave a shriek of terror, thereby choking
herself with the piece of apple she was industriously
eating, and falling on her knees, her teeth
chattering in fear, she cried frantically, “The
witches! the witches!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’m the Deil himsel’,” answered Souter in
awe-inspiring accents. Molly groaned aloud, in mortal
terror, not daring to turn around. “An’ I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
come for ye, Molly Dunn,” slowly continued her
tormentor.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” cried Molly, her eyes staring wildly
in front of her. “I want naught to do wi’ ye; gang
awa’, gang awa’!” and she wildly waved her hands
behind her.</p>

<p>“Not till ye’ve seen the face o’ the man ye’ll
wed,” replied the voice. “Beauteous fairy of Hallowe’en,
come forth,” he commanded majestically,
beckoning to Mary to come nearer. She did so.
“Speak, kind fairy.” He whispered to her what to
say to the awestruck Molly.</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Mary, who was once more her
old light-hearted winsome self, raised her sweet voice
and spoke in a high falsetto, “Gaze in the looking-glass,
Molly Dunn; eat o’ the apple, think o’ the one
ye desire to see, an’ his face will appear beside
yours.”</p>

<p>“Behold, I pass the magic wand o’er your head,
ye faithless woman,” added Souter threateningly.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Molly complied with the injunctions,
and patiently she knelt there, apple in hand, the
candle light glaring full on her eager, ugly face, and
the wisp of faded hair tied tightly on top of her head,
which was waving wildly about, while she waited for
the face to appear beside her own reflection in the
glass.</p>

<p>“Do ye see him yet?” asked Mary eagerly,
forgetting her rôle of “The Fairy of Hallowe’en,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and speaking in her natural tone, while the group
at the doorway drew closer to the kneeling woman in
their excited curiosity.</p>

<p>“Nay, not yet,” replied Molly in an awestruck
whisper.</p>

<p>“Hold the candle higher,” admonished Souter,
“an’ eat quicker.” Molly did so. “Noo do you
see your handsome lover?” He crept up slyly behind
Molly, and bending over her shoulder, peered
into the glass, where he beheld the shadowy reflection
of his own face looming up beside that of the wondering
Molly. With a gasp of pleasure not unmixed
with fear, she dropped the glass, and turning quickly
grabbed the surprised Souter and held him close. As
she raised her candle to see whom the fairies had sent
to her, she recognized her tormentor, and with a
shriek of rage, she clouted the laughing Souter over
the head with her candlestick, amid peals of laughter
from the delighted spectators, until he called for
mercy.</p>

<p>“Dinna I suit ye, Molly?” he asked in an injured
tone, nursing his sorely punished head.</p>

<p>“Ye skelpie limmer’s face, ye, how dare ye try
sich sportin’ wi’ me?” she cried angrily.</p>

<p>“The glass canna’ lie,” called out old Bess with
a shake of her frilled cap.</p>

<p>“An’ ye seen Souter’s face there, Molly,” laughed
Poosie Nancy loudly. “There’s no gainsaying
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want a braw mon, a handsome mon,” whimpered
Molly. “Ye’re no a mon at all, ye wee skelpie
limmer.” The burst of laughter which greeted this
sally was very disconcerting to Souter, whose height,
five feet two inches, was distinctly a sore subject.</p>

<p>“Try anither charm, Molly,” said Mary, feeling
sorry for the poor innocent.</p>

<p>“Aye, I will,” replied Molly eagerly, drying her
tears with the back of her hand.</p>

<p>“Then come alang,” said Souter, ready to make
amends. “Come an’ pull a stock. Gie me your
hand.” She did so eagerly. “Noo shut your eyes
tight; that’s it; come along noo.” But Molly braced
herself and refused to move.</p>

<p>“I’m afeered o’ the dark an’ the witches,” she faltered,
her teeth chattering, her eyes so tightly closed
that her face was drawn into a mass of deep wrinkles.</p>

<p>They all crowded round the couple with words of
praise and encouragement, and presently Molly was
persuaded to take a step forward and then another,
and finally the two moved slowly away and were
swallowed up in the darkness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rest of the revelers, after a whispered
consultation, hurried to the outhouse, amid
smothered shrieks of laughter.</p>

<p>Molly and Souter walked slowly and timidly toward
the field of corn, which looked unreal and shadowy
in the pale moonlight. Molly’s few remaining teeth
were now chattering so loudly that Souter began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to grow nervous. He jerked her arm impatiently.</p>

<p>“Be a mon, Molly,” he hoarsely whispered, his
voice a little shaky.</p>

<p>“I’m afeered to,” she answered, opening her eyes
and looking fearfully around. They took a few
more stumbling step, then stopped.</p>

<p>“Och, get off my foot, ye towsie tyke!” cried
Souter. Molly hastily removed the offending member
and on they went again. Suddenly they stopped,
rooted to the spot in terror. A low, blood-curdling
moan had rent the stillness. Again it came, chilling
the very blood in their veins by its awful weirdness.</p>

<p>“The witches! the witches!” gasped Molly in
abject fear.</p>

<p>Turning, they beheld a sight that caused their
hair to stand on end, “the marrow to congeal
in their bones,” as Souter afterward explained the
sensation which came over him. Coming toward
them was a score or more of hideous apparitions with
fire blazing from their eyes and their horribly grinning
mouths, and groaning and moaning like lost
souls. With a mortal cry of terror, the frightened
couple sped on wings of fear back to the friendly
light of the kitchen, the ghostly figures darting after
them with diabolical bursts of laughter. As they
slammed the door of the house behind them their pursuers
stopped and quickly blew out their Jack-o’-Lanterns
and then threw them to one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didna ken mortal mon could e’er run so fast,”
snickered Poosie Nancy to the others as they noiselessly
entered the kitchen in time to hear the wonderful
tale of Souter’s hairbreadth escape from the
witches.</p>

<p>Another hour of mirth and jollity, of dance and
song soon sped around. Souter and Molly were still
the center of an admiring group, for they had seen
the witches with their own eyes, and that distinction
was theirs alone that night. Suddenly the old clock
struck twelve, then began a merry scrambling for
bonnets and plaids. Having donned them, they
noisily crowded around their hostesses, who were
lined up against the wall, waiting ceremoniously to
be thanked for their hospitality and to bid their parting
guests godspeed. As the darts of homely wit
and repartee flew back and forth among them, causing
the lads to burst into uproarious laughter or
to grin in awkward bashfulness, and the lassies to
turn their heads away blushingly or to toss their
curls coquettishly, the door burst in suddenly, and
Tam O’Shanter staggered to the center of the floor,
pale, wild-eyed, and disheveled.</p>

<p>“Tam O’Shanter!” they cried, gazing at him in
startled amazement. Souter quickly reached his old
cronie’s side.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mon? hae ye seen a ghost?”
he asked concernedly.</p>

<p>“Aye, worse than that, much worse,” hoarsely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
replied Tam, wiping the sweat from off his forehead
with a trembling hand.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” cried old Bess fearfully.</p>

<p>“Calm yoursel’ an’ tell us, Tam,” said Souter
soothingly. They brought him a chair, for he trembled
like an aspen leaf. Throwing himself into it,
he gazed about him fearfully, the while struggling
to regain his breath.</p>

<p>“Well,’tis this way, Souter,” he began presently
in a husky whisper. “I left the Arms Inn about an
hour ago or thereabouts an’ started for hame, for
’tis a long ride to Carrick, ye ken, an’ a most uncanny
ride e’en in the daylight.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” affirmed Poosie Nancy with a nod
of conviction to the others.</p>

<p>“Weel,” continued Tam impressively, “a few
miles beyond the Maypole road ye have to pass a
dark, uncanny spot, the cairn where the hunters
found the murdered bairn. Ye ken the spot, Souter?”
turning to him for confirmation.</p>

<p>Souter nodded his head quickly. “Aye, Tam, I
ken it weel, for ’twas near there old Mingo’s mother
hanged hersel’.” Old Bess looked over her shoulder
nervously.</p>

<p>“Aye,” eagerly assented Tam, then he continued,
“Weel, a weird sight awaited me there; my blood
runs cold noo. Suddenly I heard a sound o’ music
and revelry, and Maggie stopped still, frightened
stiff. I looked up, and glimmering thro’ the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was auld Kirk Alloway all a blaze o’ light.” He
paused to note the effect of his astounding statement.</p>

<p>They looked at each other disbelievingly. Some
turned angrily away, muttering to themselves. Was
old Tam making sport of them?</p>

<p>“Go alang, mon,” cried Poosie Nancy with an
incredulous sniff of her pug nose. “’Tis naught but
an old tumbled down ruin.”</p>

<p>“I’m telling ye gospel truth,” replied Tam earnestly.
They crowded around again, ready to be
convinced, though still eying him distrustfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I was nae afraid,” continued Tam bashfully,
“for I was inspired by bold John Barleycorn,
so I rode Maggie close to the wall an’ there thro’
the openin’, I saw inside, and wow! I saw an unco
sight!” Tam was becoming warmed up with his
recital. The eager, excited faces crowding around
him had restored his courage and flattered his vanity.
He paused impressively, his eyes fixed and
staring, gazing straight past the faces of his
listeners as though he saw the unco sight again. He
noted with pleasure the frightened glances they gave
over their shoulders. Then he proceeded slowly in a
sibilant whisper, “There were warlocks and witches
dancin’ hornpipes and jigs around the Kirk, dressed
only in their sarks. There were open coffins standin’
around like clothespresses, an’ in each coffin stood a
corpse holdin’ in its cauld hand a burnin’ light. An’
by that light I saw two span-lang wee unchristened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
bairns, white and cold upon the holy table.” Tam
wiped the sweat off his brow and moistened his dry
lips; then he proceeded with his harrowing tale.
“Beside the bairns lay a bloody knife wi’ gray hairs
still sticking to the heft an’——”</p>

<p>But with a shudder of fear, their faces blanched
and drawn, they exclaimed in doubting horror,
“Nay!” “Stop!” “Out on ye, mon!” “It’s nae
true!” etc. Tam was not to be cut off in the midst
of his tale so unceremoniously.</p>

<p>He rose excitedly from his seat and continued
rapidly. “The dancers were twisting and turning
like snakes, and there in a winnock-bunker sat Auld
Nick himsel’, in the shape of a beast, playing the
pipes. Och, friends, it was an inspirin’ sight, and in
my excitement I yelled out——”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the lads in unison.</p>

<p>“‘Well done, Cutty Sark!’” shouted Tam,
proudly, well pleased at his own temerity.</p>

<p>They boisterously applauded him for his courage,
but the lassies still clung to each other nervously.</p>

<p>“Then what happened, Tam?” asked Souter quizzingly.
He could not quite bring himself to believe
Tam’s improbable tale, he knew the old sinner so
well.</p>

<p>“Weel, the lights went out in an instant,” continued
Tam dramatically. “I had no sooner turned
Maggie’s head than out poured those unco witches
like bees buzzin’ in anger. I didna’ stop to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
them, for Maggie, knowing her danger, bounded off
like a terrified deer and plunged off desperately
through the trees toward the brig with all these
witches followin’ wi’ eldritch screeches, close to her
heels till I could feel their breath on my clammy neck.
Oh, what an awful moment for me! but I knew if I
could but reach the keystone of the auld brig I
would be safe, for witches darena cross a running
stream, ye ken. Mag did her speedy utmost, but old
Nannie pursued close behind and flew at me with tooth
and nail, but she didna’ know my Maggie’s mettle,”
Tam laughed gleefully, “for with one grand leap
she reached the brig and saved her master’s life,
just as that Carline Nannie caught her by the
rump, an’ my poor Maggie left behind her old gray
tail.”</p>

<p>As he finished his recital he gazed around him
triumphantly. There was an audible sigh of relief
from all.</p>

<p>“That’s a burning shame,” said old Bess sympathetically,
alluding to the loss of Maggie’s tail.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful experience ye had, Tam,”
cried Poosie Nancy admiringly. They all congratulated
him on his narrow escape and pressed food and
drink on him, showered him with words of praise, and
in short made him out a daring hero, much to Souter’s
disgust. He sat apart from the rest in dignified
silence, his heart wounded and sore, for was not his
late ghostly exploit completely ignored and forgotten?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi,” he might have
said to himself.</p>

<p>“Listen,” cried Tam, jumping to his feet, his face
tense with eagerness. Faintly the patter, patter of
a horse’s hoofs was heard drawing nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>“’Tis only someone comin’ alang the highway,”
said Souter carelessly.</p>

<p>“’Tis my Maggie,” cried Tam almost tearfully.
“She’s comin’ back for her master,” and with a
bound he reached the open doorway. A few steps
took him to the stone wall along the other side of
which ran the King’s Highway. “She’s comin’, she’s
comin’, my faithful Maggie is comin’,” he cried joyfully.</p>

<p>“She must be an unco sight wi’out a tail, Tam,”
sneered Souter. A roar of laughter greeted this
sarcastic retort.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ ye dare laugh,” cried Tam, turning on
them furiously. The hoofbeats stopped suddenly.
In the misty moonlight they caught a glimpse of
a huge white creature, looking very spectral and
ghost-like, impatiently tossing its head from side to
side as if in search of something or someone. With
a glad cry Tam vaulted the fence, old as he was,
and dashed down the road, calling lovingly, “I’m
comin’, Maggie, I’m comin’ to ye.” A whinny of
delight, a snort of pleasure, greeted him as he reached
his old mare’s side. Then like a phantom, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
gray mare and her rider sped swiftly past them on
into the night and away toward Carrick.</p>

<p>Silently they watched them, while the hoofbeats
grew fainter and fainter and then were lost to sound.
Such was Tam O’Shanter’s tale, the fame of which
soon spread throughout all Ayrshire.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>In a sequestered spot beside the brook which runs
through the lower end of the big field at Mossgiel
farm, Robert sat dreamily watching the shallow brook
at his feet slowly trickle along over the stones. He
had left the field, his heart filled with anger against
his brother, who had been reproving him for his
thoughtlessness, his absent-mindedness; but gradually
his temper had melted, and removing his bonnet from
his fevered brow, he had given himself up to his
reveries. A little later Gilbert found him there, his
loose unbleached linen shirt open at the neck,
eagerly writing on a scrap of paper he held in his
hand.</p>

<p>The last few weeks Gilbert had thrown off his
cloak of habitual reserve, and had treated his brother
with less harshness, less severity. He had watched
the slowly drifting apart of the lovers with wonder
and delight. Could it be that they were tiring of each
other? he asked himself over and over again. If
that were so then perhaps some day—but he would
not permit himself to think of the future. He would
be happy in the present. For he was comparatively
happy now, happier than he had ever expected to be.
Since Robert’s avoidance of her, Mary had again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
turned to him for sympathy, and once more they were
on their old friendly footing. True she was a sad,
despondent companion, but he was blissfully happy
just to walk beside her from kirk, to listen to the
sound of her sweet voice, even though his brother was
the only topic of conversation, to feel the touch of
her little hand as he helped her over the stile. He
thought of all this now as he regarded his brother in
thoughtful silence. Presently he called his name.
Receiving no answer, he strode through the overhanging
willows and touched him quietly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>With a start Robert looked up into his brother’s
face, then he turned slowly away. “What is wrong
noo, Gilbert?” he asked bitterly. “It seems I will
be doing nothing right o’ late.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ is wrong, lad,” replied Gilbert, his face
reddening. “I—I only came to tell ye I am sorry I
spoke sae harshly to ye just noo.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, brother,” replied Robert quickly,
rising with outstretched hand, his face bright and
smiling. So ready was he to forgive any unkindness
when his pardon was sought. “’Tis all forgot. I
ken I do try your patience sore wi’ my forgetfulness
and carelessness, but I couldna’ help it. The voice of
the Goddess Muse, whom I adore, suddenly whispered
in my ear and I forgot my work, my surroundings,
and stood enraptured, entranced behind my patient
steed, catchin’ the thoughts and fancies that were
tumblin’, burstin’ from my brain, eager to be let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
loose, and this is the fruit o’ my inspiration almost
perfected.” He handed his brother the paper on
which he had been writing.</p>

<p>“Is it a song of harvesting?” asked Gilbert sarcastically
without glancing at it.</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Robert softly. “’Tis called the
‘Cotter’s Saturday Night,’ an’ ye will recognize, no
doubt, the character and the theme, for ’tis partly
of our own and of our father’s life I have written.
’Tis my best work, Gilbert, I ken truly.” He eagerly
watched his brother’s face as he slowly read the verses
through.</p>

<p>“May the light of success shine on it,” he said
kindly, when he had finished. “But it seems o’er
doubtful noo that the world will e’er see this, or any
of your verses, for not a word hae ye heard from
Edinburgh since ye sent Sir William Creech your
collection of poems.”</p>

<p>Robert raised his head and regarded his brother
in despairing hopelessness. “I ken it weel, brother,”
he replied. “And my heart grows sick and weary,
waitin’, waitin’, for tidings, be they good or bad.
Two lang months have passed since I sent him my
collection, an’ still not a word, not a sign. Nae doubt
they were thrown in a corner, overlooked an’ neglected.”
For a moment he stood there gazing across
the fields, his vision blurred by the tears of disappointment
which filled his eyes. “Oh, why did Lord
Glencairn raise my hopes so high?” he cried passionately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“only to have them dashed to the ground
again.” Gilbert remained silent, his eyes cast down.
The sight of his brother’s misery touched him keenly.
But there was nothing he could say. “I believed him
and trusted to his honor, his promise,” continued
Robert dejectedly, “an’ for what?” He put on his
bonnet and clasping his hands behind him in his
characteristic attitude, slowly walked toward the cottage,
a prey to his gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p>“Be patient, Rob, yet a while,” said Gilbert
encouragingly, as he walked along beside him.
“Who kens what the morrow will bring forth?”</p>

<p>“The morrow?” repeated Robert grimly. “Methinks
I’ll ne’er know peace an’ tranquillity again
on this earth.”</p>

<p>They strode on in silence. As they neared the
cottage Gilbert laid his hand on his brother’s shoulder,
bringing him to a standstill. “Robert,”
he said quietly and firmly, “I want to speak to ye
about Mary.”</p>

<p>Robert turned his head away abruptly. “What
of her?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What are your intentions toward her?” demanded
Gilbert earnestly. “Do ye intend to marry
her, or are ye but triflin’ idly wi’ her affections?”</p>

<p>Robert turned on him quickly. “Triflin’?” he
repeated indignantly. “Nay, Gilbert, ye wrong me
deeply.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, but ye ken Mary is not like other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
lassies to think lightly o’,” said Gilbert, his eye
searching his brother’s face keenly.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid,” ejaculated Robert in a low,
tense voice.</p>

<p>“I canna’ understand your conduct o’ late,” continued
Gilbert earnestly. “I fear your stay in
Mauchline is responsible for the great change in ye,
for ye are not the same lad ye were when ye left
hame. I fear ye have sadly departed from those
strict rules of virtue and moderation ye were taught
by your parents, Robert.”</p>

<p>“What mean ye, Gilbert?” inquired Robert,
startled.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rob,” responded Gilbert, shaking his head
sadly, “I ken mair than ye think; reports travel e’en
in the country.”</p>

<p>The thought that his wild escapades were known
to his narrow-minded though upright brother, and
perhaps to others, filled Robert with sudden shame.
“Weel, Gilbert,” he replied, trying to speak lightly,
“Ye ken that I have been fallin’ in love and out
again wi’ a’ the lassies ever since I was fifteen, but
nae thought of evil ever entered my mind, ye ken that
weel.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I ken that,” answered Gilbert quickly,
“until ye went to Mauchline. And noo ye have
come back a changed lad, your vows to Mary forgotten.
If I thought ye would try to wrong
her——” he stopped abruptly, for Robert had faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him, white and trembling, his eyes flashing indignantly.</p>

<p>“Stop, Gilbert!” he commanded, intensely calm.
“Mary Campbell’s purity is as sacred to me as an
angel’s in heaven. I would sooner cut my tongue
out by the roots than to willingly say aught to cause
her a moment’s misery or sorrow. Ye cruelly misjudge
me, Gilbert.” He turned away, feeling hurt
and angry that he should be so misunderstood by his
brother, and yet was he misjudging him, was he not
indeed causing her much sorrow? he asked himself
bitterly.</p>

<p>Soon the whole guilty truth must be disclosed,
his faithlessness, his unworthiness. If she suffered
now, what would be her misery when she learned
that an insurmountable barrier had arisen between
them, cruelly separating them forever. The thought
filled him with unspeakable anguish.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Rob, for my hasty words,” said
Gilbert remorsefully. “But ye ken Mary is very
dear to—to us all; that is why I spoke so plainly.”</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the cottage opened and
the object of their discussion stepped into view. The
poor little moth could not help fluttering around the
candle, and so she was to be found at Mossgiel whenever
her duties would permit her to steal away.</p>

<p>“Oh, here ye are, lads,” she called out to them,
her face brightening. “Will ye be comin’ in to tea
noo?” They did not answer. “My, what long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
faces ye both have,” she continued, smiling. “This
isna’ the Sabbath Day, so there’s no need of such
sorrowful faces.”</p>

<p>“I didna’ ken ye were here,” answered Gilbert,
going toward her.</p>

<p>Robert sat down by the well, the look of pain on
his melancholy face deepening as he listened to her
gentle voice. He closed his eyes wearily and leaned
back against the curbing, the paper held loosely in
his hand. It was so hard to realize that never again
would he press that form to his aching heart, that he
must renounce her utterly. Oh, if he could only die
now, how much better it would be for them all, he
weakly told himself.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stay here to tea wi’ ye this night,”
said Mary wistfully. Why didn’t Robert speak to
her just one word of greeting? she thought sadly.
“Your mother bade me tell ye supper is waiting
whenever ye are ready.” She took a few halting
steps toward the well. “Are ye comin’ in, Robert?”
she inquired timidly.</p>

<p>“In a wee,” he answered quietly, without looking
at her. “After I have finished my poem.” Mary
turned back, crushed to the heart by his apparent
coldness.</p>

<p>“Weel, lads,” cried Mrs. Burns brightly, stepping
out on the low, broad stoop followed by Souter, who
held a cup of steaming tea in one hand and some oatcakes
in the other, on which he nibbled with evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
relish. “I heard your voices and couldna’ stay
within,” and she beamed on them lovingly.</p>

<p>“Ye’re at it again, I see, Robert,” observed Souter
tactlessly. Robert flushed angrily. He was
easily irritated in his present state of mind. “Ye’ll
write yoursel’ into the grave, mon; ye’re not lookin’
very peart the noo.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns regarded her eldest son with anxious
eyes. “Aye, I fear, laddie, ye are too intent on your
rhymin’,” she said solicitously. His abstracted moods,
his melancholy moroseness had filled her loving heart
with gloomy forebodings. “Sae much livin’ in the
clouds, my son, is unhealthful, an’ does but make ye
moody an’ uncertain in temper. Is it worth while
to wreck body, mind an’ soul to gain a little fame
an’ fortune, which, alas, seem so very far off?” she
asked, putting her hand lovingly on his bowed head.</p>

<p>“Ye dinna’ understand, mither,” he replied sadly.
“I love to write. ’Tis my very life; thought flows
unbidden from my brain.” He rose to his feet and
pointing to the stream, which could be faintly seen
at the foot of the hill, continued with mournful finality,
“Why, mother, I might as well try to stop the
waters of yonder rushin’ brook as to attempt to
smother the poetic fancies that cry for utterance.
Nay, ’tis too late noo to dissuade me from my purpose,”
and he turned and watched the setting sun
slowly sink behind the distant hills in a flood of golden
splendor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Souter noticed with uneasiness the gloom which
had settled upon them all as the result of his careless
words. Why was he such a thoughtless fool?
Ah, well, he would make them forget their troubles.</p>

<p>“Och, Mistress Burns,” he cried, smacking his
lips with apparent relish, “’tis a mighty fine cup
of tea, a perfectly grand cup. It fair cheers the
heart of mon,” and he drained it to the bottom.</p>

<p>“An’ where do ye think the oatcakes were made,
Souter?” asked Mary brightly.</p>

<p>“Weel, I’m no’ a good hand at guessin’,” he answered,
thoughtfully scratching his head; “but by
their taste an’ sweetness, I should say that Mistress
Burns made them hersel’.”</p>

<p>The good dame regarded him witheringly. “I
didna’ ken that oatcakes were sweet, Souter,” she
retorted.</p>

<p>Mary laughed softly at his discomfiture. “Weel,
they come frae my sister in Applecross.”</p>

<p>“Applecross!” he repeated, his face lighting up
with pleasure. “Noo I mind they did have the Highland
flavor, for true.”</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ ye finished the last one for that reason,
no doubt,” replied Mrs. Burns wrathfully. “Ye’re
a pig, mon. Come awa’, lads, your supper will be
gettin’ cold,” and she led the way inside, followed
meekly by Souter. Gilbert waited for Mary to
enter, but she stood wistfully gazing at Robert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
With a sigh he left them together, and Robert entered
the cottage.</p>

<p>Mary slowly approached Robert as he stood looking
across to the distant hills, and patiently waited
for him to speak to her, but he stood there in tense
silence, not daring to trust himself to even look
at the pure flower-like face held up to his so pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Robbie,” she said timidly after a pause, which
seemed interminable to them both, “willna’ ye let
the sunlight enter your heart an’ be your old bonnie
sel’ once mair? It will make us all sae happy.”
She put her hand on his arm lovingly. “Why are
ye sae changed, laddie? Dinna’ ye want me to love
ye any mair?”</p>

<p>At the gentle touch of her fingers an uncontrollable
wave of passionate love and longing came over
him, sweeping away all resolutions resistlessly.
“Oh, my Mary, my Mary,” he cried hoarsely. “I
do want your love, I do want it noo an’ forever,”
and he clasped her lovingly to his aching heart.
Blissfully she lay in his strong arms while he showered
her flushed and happy face with the hungry,
fervent, loving kisses which he had denied
himself so long, and murmured little caressing words
of endearment which filled her soul with rapture and
happiness. “How I love ye, Mary,” he breathed in
her ear again and again as he held her close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ how happy ye make me once mair, laddie,”
she answered, nestling against him lovingly.</p>

<p>“An’ how happy we will——,” he began, then
stopped pale and trembling, for grim recollection
had suddenly loomed up before him with all its train
of bitter, ugly facts; and conscience began to drum
insistently into his dulled ear. “Tell her the truth
now, the whole truth,” it said. But the voice of the
tempter whispered persuasively, saying, “Why tell
her now? wait, let her be happy while she may, put
it off as long as possible.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Robbie?” cried Mary fearfully.
“Tell me what is troublin’ ye; dinna’ be afraid.”
His bowed head bent lower and lower.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary, I’m sae unworthy, sae unworthy of all
your pure thoughts, your tender love,” he faltered
despairingly, resolved to tell her all. “Ye dinna’ ken
all my weakness, my deception, and into what depths
of sin I have fallen.” She sought to interrupt him,
but he continued rapidly, his voice harsh with the
nervous tension, his face pallid from the stress of
his emotions. “I have a confession to make ye——”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, laddie,” cried Mary, putting her hand
over his trembling lips. “Dinna’ tell me anything.
I want nae confession from ye, except that o’ your
love,” and she smoothed his cheek tenderly. “Ye
ken that is music to my ears at all times, but if ye
are deceivin’ me, if ye have na always been true
to me, an’ your vows, why, laddie, keep the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to yourself’. I am content noo, and ye ken
happiness is such a fleetin’ thing that I mean to cling
to it as long as I can.” She took his hands in both
her own and held them close to her heart. “Ye ken,
Robbie, ill news travels apace and ’twill reach my
ears soon enough,” she continued with a mournful
little quaver in her voice. “But no matter what
comes, what ye may do, my love for ye will overlook
it all; I will see only your virtues, my love, not your
vices.”</p>

<p>Robert bowed his head in heart-broken silence.
Grief, shame, and remorse like tongues of fiery flames
were scorching and burning into his very soul.
Quietly they sat there engrossed in their thoughts,
till the voice of Mrs. Burns calling to them from the
cottage to come to supper roused them from their
lethargy.</p>

<p>“We’re comin’ right awa’,” answered Mary
brightly. “Come, laddie, we mustna’ keep the folks
waitin’.”</p>

<p>She took his listless hand and drew him gently to
the door and into the cottage.</p>

<p>Silently they took their places at the table, around
which the others were already seated.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said old blind Donald, the fiddler,
who had dropped in on his way to Mauchline for a
bite and a cup, “Poosie Nancy told me to tell ye,
Mistress Burns, that she wa drop in to see ye this
night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to see her,” replied Mrs. Burns
hospitably.</p>

<p>“And Daddy Auld says he’ll be along, too,” continued
Donald, grinning broadly. “That is, if he
isna’ too busy convertin’ souls.”</p>

<p>“Convertin’ souls,” sneered Souter incredulously.</p>

<p>“Aye, ye should see the Jolly Beggars he was
haranguin’. They were jumpin’, an’ rantin’, an’
singin’ like daft Methodists.”</p>

<p>“The auld hypocrites!” cried Mrs. Burns, buttering
a scone which she placed in the old man’s tremulous
hand. “They didna’ go to the manse for conversion;
’tis a square meal they are after. They ken
the kind old heart o’ Daddy Auld.”</p>

<p>Souter leaned back in his chair and smiled reminiscently.
“That reminds me o’ a guid story,” he began,
chuckling.</p>

<p>“Never mind that story noo,” remonstrated Mrs.
Burns, who was in constant dread of Souter’s risque
stories. “That’ll keep.”</p>

<p>“I never <i>can</i> tell that damn story,” ejaculated Souter
wrathfully.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p>They had finished their meager supper, and now
sat comfortably around the fire, Mrs. Burns and
Mary busy with their knitting, the men contentedly
smoking, while old Donald discordantly tuned up his
fiddle.</p>

<p>“Noo, Donald,” said Souter briskly, “play us
something lively.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I’ll play ye the Highland Fling, Souter
Johnny, an’ ye can dance. Come alang noo,” and
he started to play vigorously, keeping time with his
foot.</p>

<p>“Aye, get out on the floor, Souter,” said Gilbert,
pulling him out of his chair.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, lad,” expostulated Souter fretfully,
“I be too old to fling the toe noo.”</p>

<p>“Go alang wi’ ye, mon,” retorted Mrs. Burns
encouragingly; “a Scotsman, and a Highlander besides,
is ne’er too old to——”</p>

<p>“To learn,” interrupted Gilbert brightly, swinging
the old man to the middle of the floor. “Let her
go.”</p>

<p>“I havena danced for years,” said Souter apologetically.
Carefully knocking the ashes out of his
pipe he deposited it in the pocket of his capacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
waistcoat and proceeded to divest himself of his coat.
“Ye ken I was the champion dancer of my clan, Clan
McDougal, when I was a young lad,” he announced
boastingly. “An’ mony a time I have cheered an’
amused the lads, while tentin’ on the fields of Culloden,
before the big battle. An’ that reminds me o’
a guid——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the story,” said Gilbert impatiently.
“Gie us a dance.”</p>

<p>After a few preliminary movements Souter caught
the swinging measure of the dance, and once started
he limbered up surprisingly. On he danced nimbly,
and untiringly, soon ably proving to his delighted audience
that he had not forgotten his old-time accomplishment.
“I’ll show these Lowlanders what a
Highlander can do,” thought the old man proudly.
Panting with excitement and eagerness he failed to
hear the metallic patter of horses’ hoofs drawing
near the cottage. Nearer and nearer they came
unheeded by all save one.</p>

<p>From his seat by the fireplace, where he sat in
melancholy silence, Robert heard the sound, but gave
it no heed. Suddenly it ceased. He raised his head
to listen. Someone had surely stopped at the gate,
he thought, straining his ears eagerly, but the noise
of the fiddle and the dancing drowned all sound
from without. He glanced quickly at the smiling
faces of the others as they good-naturally watched
the dancer. “I must hae been mistaken,” he muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
uneasily. Suddenly he leaned forward, grasping
his chair hard; surely he had heard his name
faintly called. He listened intently. Yes, there it
was again; this time the voice was nearer. A woman’s
voice, too. What could it mean? He rose to his
feet, his heart thumping fiercely, his muscles alert
and tense, his eyes fixed on the door, his mind filled
with gloomy presentiment.</p>

<p>At that moment an imperative knock sounded
loudly through the room, and almost at the same time
the door flew open violently, and Jean Armour impetuously
dashed in. Closing the door quickly behind
her she leaned back against it, pale and
exhausted. Her riding habit of green and gold was
splashed and discolored with mud. The large hat
with its gleaming white plume hung limply over her
shoulder, while her black disheveled hair streamed
over her face and down her back in bewildering confusion.
She had evidently ridden fast and furious,
for she stood there with her eyes closed, her hand on
her heart, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Quickly Mrs. Burns led the exhausted girl to a
seat. In a few moments she raised her drooping head
and with wild frightened eyes searched the room till
her gaze fell on Robert, who was leaning white and
speechless against the fireplace, a great fear in his
heart.</p>

<p>She rose quickly and going to him said in a tense,
rapid whisper, “Robert, my father knows all, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
through no fault of mine. Some idle gossip reached
his ear to-day, and when he returned home and learned
my condition his rage was terrible. He cursed you
like a madman, and would have done me bodily harm
had I remained within sight. But I feared for my
life, and fled before I had explained the truth to him.
I have come to you to protect me.”</p>

<p>He listened to her in stony silence. The blow had
fallen so suddenly, so unexpectedly, it found him
totally unprepared to ward off its paralyzing effects.
He tried to speak, but the words refused to leave his
parched tongue. He felt benumbed and cold, all the
blood in his body seeming to have suddenly congealed.
As he stood there with the eyes of all riveted upon
him he felt like the veriest criminal that walked the
earth.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a tense silence. Jean
stood there anxiously gazing into Robert’s stricken
face, as he vainly strove to utter a sound. Mary
had watched the little scene before her in growing
wonder and alarm and now leaned back against the
wall, her heart beating with some unknown, nameless
fear. What did this highborn lady want with her
laddie? she asked herself jealously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘She is my wife, mither.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Burns stood grimly waiting for some explanation
of the scene she had just witnessed, but
had not heard nor understood. “Robert, my son,”
she said finally, her voice cold and firm, “what
does Squire Armour’s daughter want of ye?” There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was no answer. “What is she to ye, Robert?”
she sternly insisted. Slowly he raised his head. As
she saw his wild and haggard face, from which all
the life and youth had fled, she started back in
horror, a startled exclamation on her lips.</p>

<p>With a despairing, heart-broken look at Mary’s
wondering face, he bowed his head and falteringly
uttered the fatal words, “She is my wife, mither.”</p>

<p>Had a thunderbolt from a clear sky unroofed
the humble cot, it would not have created the consternation,
the terror which those few words struck
to those loving hearts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns was the first to rally from the shock.
“Your wife?” she repeated incredulously, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>With a cry of grief and pain Mary sank weak
and trembling into a chair, like a deer wounded unto
death. She gazed at them heart-brokenly, while her
little hands nervously fluttered about her face. No,
no, he could not mean it. They were only joking,
surely. “Not that, Robbie, ye dinna mean that,
dearie?” she gasped piteously, holding out a beseeching
hand to him. His bowed head bent lower.</p>

<p>“Do ye mean ye have legally married this lass?”
asked Gilbert eagerly. Mary would be free then,
he thought wildly. Free to be wooed and won.</p>

<p>“We were married a few weeks ago,” answered
Robert dully. “I had not the courage to tell ye
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” interposed Jean, arranging her disordered
toilet, “I wished to keep the marriage from my
father for a—a time.” She blushed crimson.</p>

<p>“I willna believe my son ever married ye of his
own free will,” cried Mrs. Burns bitterly, “fine
rich lady that ye are. He loves only that sweet
lass, Mary Campbell.” Quickly she reached Mary’s
side, and, raising the stricken child in her motherly
arms, she kissed her tenderly and pressed the golden
head gently against her loving heart.</p>

<p>Jean looked at them, a look of resentment in her
flashing eyes. “I know that full well,” she answered
sullenly. “I know Robert hasn’t married me because
he wanted to, but because——” she looked down
shame-faced. “Because there was no alternative.
Now you know the truth,” she concluded bitterly.</p>

<p>“Ye shameless creature!” cried Mrs. Burns, her
eyes blazing with indignation. “Ye have trapped
him into this marriage, but ye shall na stay beneath
this roof, ye limmer,” and she glared at the flushed
defiant girl in righteous anger.</p>

<p>“Mither, mither!” cried Robert distractedly,
“dinna, for God’s sake; she is my wife in truth, an’
she must stay wi’ me noo till I can prepare anither
hame for her. Dinna make it harder for me.” He
gazed pleadingly in his mother’s stern and angry
face.</p>

<p>Mary pressed her lips to the quivering cheek.
“Mistress Burns,” she said softly, “what is to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
will be. I forgive them both wi’ all my heart.” She
paused and sighed with gentle resignation. Then she
continued, “An’—an’ I hope they will both find peace
in their new life.” She turned quietly to Jean, who
was nervously tapping her whip against her skirt.
“I ken ye’ll make Robert a good wife,” she said
earnestly. “So dinna let any thought o’ me sadden
your heart, or—or yours, Robert.” She turned and
looked at him tenderly. “I—I forgive ye,” she
whispered. Turning to Mrs. Burns again, she continued
pleadingly, “Ye must welcome Robert’s wife
to her new hame, Mistress Burns. We all maun make
this a merry hame-comin’ for—the—bride.” Her
plaintive voice broke abruptly, and the burning tears
welled up to her eyes, but she dashed them quickly
away and continued bravely, a pathetic little smile
hovering about her trembling lips, “I’ll go out noo
an’ make some fresh tea for ye, and ye’ll all stay
right here, till I come back, an’ Donald shall play
for ye again—an’ we’ll—all—be—sae merry—won’t
w-we? I’ll bring it w-when—it’s quite—ready.”
She smiled at them through her tears. Then she took
the teapot from the dresser and softly left the room.</p>

<p>“God bless her brave and noble heart,” breathed
Robert brokenly.</p>

<p>As she left the room Mrs. Burns drew herself
sternly erect, and after a moment’s hesitation turned
slowly to Jean. “I bid ye welcome to Mossgiel
Farm,” she said coldly. “I am sorry I spoke so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bitterly to ye just noo. I—I will try to love ye as
Robert’s wife, but noo I—I can only think o’ Mary
an’ her sorrow. I’ll leave ye for a bit; Mary may need
me.” Her voice faltered and broke, and with a sob
of grief she hurriedly left the room.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>Ever since the morning she had received her marriage
lines Jean had been trying to summon up
sufficient courage to tell her father the whole truth
about her secret marriage to Robert, to throw herself
upon his mercy, but each time when she had
approached him in fear and trembling, her courage
had ignominiously failed her. She knew only too
well her father’s irascible temper and uncertain
moods. And so days passed into weeks and still
she procrastinated, but she knew she could not conceal
from his observing eyes her condition much
longer. But whether to confess all and run the
risk of being thrown from her father’s door like
some abandoned outcast, or to contrive some excuse
to leave home to pay a visit to some friend, and
then, when it was all over, to return, that was the
question which disturbed her waking thoughts. If
she did the latter, she thought, she could easily have
her marriage annulled and no one would be the wiser.
But did she really want to have her marriage annulled?
she asked herself thoughtfully. She didn’t understand
herself at all these days. He had strangely
stirred her heart at their last meeting, to its very
depths. She knew he did not love her, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
loved the little dairymaid, but almost imperceptibly
a great change was taking place in her feelings toward
him. At times a great longing came over her
to go to him, throw herself at his feet and beg to
share his hardships, his poverty, with him. But she
had not the courage, and so she battled with the conflicting
emotions that constantly beset her day and
night. Her temper soon became moody and uncertain,
she was in constant fear of her mother’s anxious,
watchful eyes, and yet she felt she would go daft if
she remained alone in her chamber with her disturbing
thoughts. So day after day she could be found in
her saddle madly galloping over the country, trying
to get away, far away, from her trouble. But all in
vain; it was always before her; there was no escaping
it. But at last the day came when she knew she
must make her decision, and almost in desperation
she decided on her course of procedure. Hastily
galloping home, she left her horse at the door, and
going to her room, scribbled a short note to her father
and left it on the table in his study. Then she had
slipped guiltily past the room where her mother sat
peacefully sewing, and sped swiftly along the hall to
the door. As she reached it, it burst inward and she
staggered back half fainting, for there on the threshold
stood her father, his face white with rage, his
jaw set and determined. He seized her roughly by
the arm, and thrusting her back into the house, had
taken one understanding look at her figure in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
tight-fitting habit, then with an outburst of bitter
anger and shame he cursed her and the author
of her disgrace, cursed her like a madman, cursed
her till he was spent with the force of his passion.
She tried to explain, to tell him the truth, that she
was a wife, but the words froze on her lips. His
words and manner struck terror to her very soul;
she feared for her very life’s safety. With all her
despairing strength she freed herself from his
clutch and stood cowering, panting, her hands raised
to shield herself from the blow she expected every
moment to fall on her defenseless body from the
insane man. As he approached her with hand upraised,
she gave one quick shriek, one wild look
around and darting under his arm reached the door.
Quickly she opened it and sped like a swallow to the
side of her waiting horse. With one bound she was
on his back, and away she galloped like the wind,
leaving her astonished father standing in the doorway
shaking his fist after her in impotent anger.</p>

<p>She had given rein to her horse, not heeding or
caring where he took her. Her one and only thought
was to get away, far away; so she rode on and
on, over brook and brush, through bog and mire
till gradually her fear had subsided, and, reining
in her horse, she looked around, and with a thrill
of joy and wonder she saw Mossgiel Farm in the
distance. Surely fate had guided her horse’s footsteps
in this direction, she thought eagerly. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
course was clear now, she would go to him, to her
husband, he would protect her. So she had continued
her journey to the cottage, where she brought naught
but misery and sorrow to its inmates.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Burns left the room Jean gazed after her
in bitter silence. She wished she had not come. She
knew she was not welcome. Far better to have faced
her father’s anger. “But the die is cast. I have
made my bed,” she told herself wearily. She realized
how futile it was to repine over the past, and she felt
too exhausted, too miserably unhappy to think of the
future. She would stay here perhaps a night, then
she didn’t know, couldn’t think what would happen.
At all events she could never return to her father’s
home now. He had spurned her from him, and she
was not wanted here. Nobody wanted her now. Her
lips quivered convulsively and big tears of self-pity
rolled quietly down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Gilbert looked uneasily from his brother’s grief-stricken
face to the weary, wan face of the bride.
How long were they going to sit there side by side
without a word to each other? he thought uneasily.
He felt a great wave of pity well up in his heart for
the unwelcome, unloved addition to their family.
True she was mostly to blame for her present misfortune.
Her imprudence, her misconduct had been
well known to many, before his brother had gone to
Mauchline to live. He felt sorry for Robert, too,
even while he bitterly reproached him for being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
author of Mary’s unhappiness. They must make the
best of things now, he thought philosophically. “Ye
had better take off your bonnet, lassie,” he said
kindly, breaking the oppressive silence. “Ye’ll be
staying here the night.” She raised her head and
looked at him with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Full well I know that all here hate and despise
me,” she burst forth bitterly, not heeding his request.</p>

<p>Robert slowly raised his head and looked at her.
There was sorrow and compassion in his dark melancholy
eyes. “Jean,” he said quietly, “our lives
have been linked togither by a stern, inexorable fate.
We have both been guilty of a grievous sin, and noo
we must face the results bravely.” He rose and
walked to her and stood humbly by her side. “I
hope ye’ll forgive me, Jean, for wreckin’ your life
and plungin’ ye into sae much misery.”</p>

<p>Slowly Jean bowed her head, her face flushing
guiltily. Surely she had the more need to ask his
forgiveness. She had not expected to find such nobility
of character, and it moved her deeply.</p>

<p>“There is naught to forgive,” she cried in a low
stifled voice. “I alone am to blame. I am unfit,
unworthy to be your wife. Oh, I’m so miserable, so
unhappy,” and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Souter led old Donald silently out of the room.
There was nothing either one could say to the
wretched couple, so they sat outside and talked it
all over in the way old men have. They had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
been seated long, however, when they espied coming
toward them, at a furious gallop, a horse and rider.
As they drew near Souter perceived with sudden
apprehension that it was none other than Squire
Armour. He rose anxiously to his feet.</p>

<p>“Do ye ken wha’ it is, Souter?” inquired Donald
in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>“It’s Squire Armour himsel’,” whispered Souter
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Ma certie!” ejaculated Donald, shaking his
white locks in mild alarm.</p>

<p>“I’d better warn the lass,” said Souter hastily,
as the Squire drew up to the gate. Going to the
door he quickly told them of the newcomer, then
turned to intercept the irate visitor, who was coming
swiftly up the walk.</p>

<p>“Heavens, my father here!” cried Jean in a
frightened whisper. “Oh, I dare not face his wrath.
Protect me, Robert,” and she clung to him fearfully.</p>

<p>“Out o’ my way, mon!” they heard the harsh
voice of Squire Armour shouting. “Out o’ my
way,” and pushing aside the courageous little man he
strode wrathfully into the room.</p>

<p>“Weel, I’ll stay and see the fun through,” said
Souter to himself grimly.</p>

<p>“So, my lass,” cried the old Squire triumphantly,
“I’ve found ye just where I expected ye’d be, in the
arms o’ your dissolute lover. Come awa’, ye shameless
bairn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>He started toward her, but Robert passed
her quickly behind him.</p>

<p>“Keep back, Squire Armour,” he said firmly.
“I’m nae a mild-mannered man, an’ ye may learn it
to your cost.”</p>

<p>Squire Armour glanced at him savagely. “Dinna
ye dare talk to me, ye libertine, ye blasphemous
rhymster. Ye dare to stand there wi’ my daughter,
proclaiming her dishonor to my very eyes?”</p>

<p>“There is no dishonor, Squire Armour,” replied
Robert calmly, “for your daughter is—my wife.”</p>

<p>“Your wife!” echoed the old man, staggering
back in amazement. “I’ll nae believe it. It’s a lie.
I’d rather see my daughter disgraced forever than be
your wife.”</p>

<p>“Father, are you mad?” gasped Jean in horrified
accents.</p>

<p>“An’ ye an Elder in the Kirk, a so-called ‘God-fearin’
man’!” cried Robert scathingly, his eyes
blazing with scorn. “I tell ye, Squire Armour, she
is my wife, an’ all your bitter, unreasoning hatred
o’ me canna’ alter that unhappy fact.”</p>

<p>For a moment the old man stood gazing at them
in helpless rage. Then he turned to Jean, his voice
trembling with suppressed emotion. “What proofs
have ye?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I have my marriage lines, father,” she answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“Where were ye married?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, father, we——” began Jean hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Was it in the Kirk?” he interrupted sternly.</p>

<p>“No,” she faltered. “It was——”</p>

<p>“Not in the Kirk?” he cried, his voice rising
menacingly. “Who was the minister? Who married
ye?”</p>

<p>“There was no minister, father.”</p>

<p>“Nae minister!” he exclaimed in horror.</p>

<p>“Wait, father, you don’t understand,” cried Jean
quickly; “’twas a Scotch marriage; ye ken what that
is—and,” she bowed her head guiltily, “why it is.
And here are my lines signed by Robert acknowledging
me as his wife.” She took from the bosom of her
gown a folded paper which she handed to her father.</p>

<p>He read it through carefully. “This is na legal
or binding,” he exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>“’Tis perfectly legal, Squire Armour,” replied
Robert calmly, “even if it is irregular, and is as binding
as though we were married in Kirk.”</p>

<p>“It shall be set aside,” fumed the old man. “I
will not have it so. Ye shall both renounce it, I
tell ye.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” cried Jean tearfully, going to his
side. “’Tis too late now; would you shame me in
the eyes of the world?”</p>

<p>“Do these few written lines make your shame
any the less?” he shouted wrathfully. “Will not
all the neighbors know why he had to give them to
ye? Ye would throw awa’ your life on this poverty-stricken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shiftless rhymster, but ye shall not do it;
ye must give him up, do ye hear?” and he raised
his arm menacingly.</p>

<p>“No, no, no, father,” she exclaimed frantically,
falling on her knees beside him; “I cannot give
him up now, I cannot.” After all the weary weeks
of anxious fears and doubts she knew at last that
she had found her heart, and now asked no greater
happiness than to be allowed to remain with her husband
to share his humble life, to be the mother of his
family. All the old ambitious thoughts were gone
forever. She wondered that they ever existed.</p>

<p>“Ye shameless bairn, ye must an’ shall!” he replied
fiercely. “This is the end o’ it all,” and he
vindictively tore into little bits the paper Jean had
given into his hands. “We’ll hear nae mair of that,
my lass, an’ I swear ye shall never see Robert Burns
again, make up your mind to that.”</p>

<p>With a cry of despair Jean sank half fainting
into a chair.</p>

<p>As he witnessed Squire Armour’s fiendish act
Robert’s heart gave a great bound that sent the
blood coursing madly through his veins. The marriage
lines were destroyed; then he was free, free!
Oh, the music in that word! Free to do as he
wished. A sob of anguish caused him to look around
at the kneeling figure of the unfortunate girl.
Quickly the eager light died out of his face as he
noted her suffering. Going to the kneeling girl he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
raised her gently to her feet, and holding her by the
hand faced the inhuman father. “Squire Armour,
ye would condemn your ain flesh an’ blood to shame
an’ disgrace because o’ your hatred for me,” he said
quietly, “but it shall not be. I defy ye. Come,
Jean, we will go to the Kirk at once and Daddy Auld
will marry us.” They turned to go, but the old man
stepped between them and the door, his arms upraised,
his eyes wild and glaring.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner see her in her grave than bear the
accursed name of Robert Burns,” he cried with
solemn intensity. “Great though her imprudence
has been, she can still look to a higher, an’ better
connection than a marriage with ye.” Turning to
Jean he continued sternly, “Speak, lass, say that
ye’ll obey me, or the bitter curse o’ your parents
will haunt an’ follow ye all the rest o’ your
days.”</p>

<p>“Think of the disgrace, father,” wailed the unhappy
girl, clinging to his arm beseechingly.</p>

<p>“We’ll forget and forgive it all if ye’ll come
back,” he replied, the great love for his child revealing
itself in his eager tones. “Ye’re nae longer that
man’s wife. Come an’ none will ever know o’ your
dishonor.”</p>

<p>“My God, mon!” exclaimed Robert in horrified
accents, “where is your father’s pride, your ain
honor, your manhood!”</p>

<p>But Squire Armour heeded him not. “Come, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
daughter, come,” he said tenderly, leading the weak,
wavering girl to the door.</p>

<p>“Ye canna expect to keep this a secret from the
world, Squire Armour,” cried Robert indignantly.
“Matters have gone too far for that; soon your
daughter’s name will be blasted irretrievably, while
mine will be coupled with that of blackguard. It
must not be. Ye must let Jean go to the Kirk wi’
me this very night or I shall inform the Elders in the
Kirk.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll have no time to turn informer, my laddie,”
snarled Squire Armour, turning on him fiercely;
“for I mean to have ye brought before the Kirk
sessions, an’ ye’ll be punished as ye deserve for the sin
ye have committed, an’ ye shall sit on the cutty
stool, where all your friends an’ neighbors can jeer
an’ scoff at ye. This very night will I send the
parish officers after ye, Robert Burns. Ye can take
this warning or no, just as ye please, but I hope they
find ye here. Come, lass, we’ll go hame to your
mither, noo.” He drew the terrified, half-fainting
girl firmly through the door and down the path to the
road.</p>

<p>“Ye’re an old hypocrite!” hooted Souter, following
them to the gate, where he stood shaking his fist
angrily after the departing visitors, and shouting his
frank opinion of the Squire in no mild or flattering
terms.</p>

<p>“I alone am to blame,” cried Robert despairingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as he watched them gallop madly away into the
threatening night. “An’ only the bitterest sorrow,
the most poignant grief will I know until that wrong
is righted.”</p>

<p>“What will ye do noo, lad?” asked Mrs. Burns,
breaking in upon the melancholy sadness which enveloped
him like a pall. (She had entered the room
in time to hear Squire Armour’s parting injunction.)
“Ye heard what the Squire threatened. Oh, dinna
disdain the littleness of prudence, my son.”</p>

<p>“I willna, mother,” replied Robert dully, after a
pause. “I have decided to go awa’ from Mossgiel.”</p>

<p>“Go awa’?” she repeated fearfully. “Nay, nay,
laddie, ye mustna! I fear for ye in your present
state o’ mind.”</p>

<p>“I must, mother,” he answered wildly. “I willna
sit on the cutty stool to be made the laughing stock
o’ the whole neighborhood, to bring shame on ye
all.” He walked restlessly up and down the room
as he continued feverishly, “I willna stay here to
skulk from covert to covert under all the terrors
of a jail, for I ken that in a little while the merciless
pack of the law will be baying at my heels
like bloodhounds.” He turned to her suddenly,
“Mother, I mean to leave Scotland, perhaps forever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nay, nay, my bairn; I canna, I willna, let ye
go,” answered his mother, clinging to him passionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, there, mither, dinna make it harder for
me.” He put his arm around her tenderly and pressed
her to him for a moment. “Noo, mother,” he said
quietly, “will ye pack my chest? I have nae time to
spare,” and he led her gently to the door.</p>

<p>“Where will ye be goin’?” inquired Gilbert.</p>

<p>“To the Indies, to Jamaica,” replied Robert
quickly. “Ye ken Dr. Douglas has a place for me
there as overseer of his plantation. He has offered
it to me mony times.” He turned in nervous haste
to his mother, who stood in the doorway anxiously
watching him. “Hurry, mither, please, I am in torture
o’ mind.”</p>

<p>“Very well, laddie,” she answered sorrowfully.
“God will direct your footsteps aright,” and she
closed the door behind her and quickly made her way
to his chamber.</p>

<p>“Will ye see Mary before ye go, Robert?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p>He felt an infinite pity for his brother, who was
leaving behind him everything he held dear.</p>

<p>“If she will come to me,” faltered Robert. “Tell
her I’m goin’ an’ that I will go wi’ a lighter heart
if she bids me godspeed. Watch o’er an’ protect
her, Gilbert,” he continued, placing his hand on his
brother’s shoulder. “An’ I hope one day she may
forget faithless Robert Burns, an’—an’ ye, Gilbert,
will be made happy.” He turned away as he
finished, grief gnawing at his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>An eager light flashed in Gilbert’s eyes as he answered
fervently, “I would lay doon my life to serve
her,” and with a quick look into the averted face he
quietly left the room.</p>

<p>Mechanically Rob took his bonnet from the peg
and throwing his long plaid around him went out into
the air, and silently, sorrowfully he stood there
watching the gloomy clouds that hung low in the
heavens through eyes misty with tears. His soul
was filled with unutterable sorrow at the coming
parting, with dread of the unknown future to be
passed alone in a strange, inhospitable foreign land.
Oh, the agony of that thought, alone! Suddenly
there came floating softly, peacefully, borne on the
back of the south wind, which was blowing gently
against his face, the alluring, seductive voice of the
Goddess Muse. Insistently she urged her way into
the dulled and listless ear of the grief-stricken man.
Not for long was she denied admission, however.
With a cry of joy, that even in that dreaded hour of
parting his Goddess had not deserted him, he eagerly
opened the book he held in his hand, his favorite book,
“Tristam Shandy” by Sterne, and wrote quickly,
lovingly on the flyleaf the impassioned words which
were being whispered in his ear. Hungrily the pencil
sped over the paper, till, with a sigh of regret,
he dropped his hand, the voice was hushed, the message
was finished. As he stood there eagerly reading
his verses by the light which streamed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the window, the door softly opened and Mary came
swiftly to his side, her pure face pitiful in its childlike
sorrow.</p>

<p>“Is it true ye are gang awa’ frae Scotland, Robbie?”
she asked breathlessly. He bowed his head.
“Oh, my heart beats heavy for ye, laddie.” There
was infinite compassion in her voice. “But ye maun
be brave noo if ever ye were.” She nestled her little
hand in his. He clasped it fervently.</p>

<p>“O, Mary, my Highland lassie!” he cried passionately,
“I want to hear ye say before I go that ye
forgive me for the sorrow I have brought into your
pure young life.”</p>

<p>“Hush, laddie,” she answered softly, “there is
naught to forgive; ye had to do your duty like
an honorable mon. I hae been very happy wi’
ye, laddie, an’ the memory o’ that happiness will
be wi’ me always.” She leaned against him for a
brief moment, then slowly drew herself away and
looked tenderly up into his face. “In this sad parting
hour,” she faltered, “I can tell ye without shame
that I love ye wi’ a’ my being, an’ will until I
dee.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless ye, Mary,” he whispered brokenly.
“The thought of your love will gie me courage to
bear my exile bravely.”</p>

<p>“Exile!” she repeated shuddering. “Oh, what a
drear word, to think ye must be exiled in your noble
youth, that ye maun leave your hame, your country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to live alone in some foreign clime.” The tears
streamed down her pallid cheeks. “We will a’ miss
ye sair, lad,” she continued bravely, “and we will
pray for ye, an’—an’—oh, ’twill be sae hard to say
good-by, perhaps forever.” She threw her arms
about his neck and clung to him passionately.</p>

<p>He held the weeping child in his strong, loving
embrace, his face close to hers. “Oh, why was I
born, only to bring sorrow, pain an’ disgrace to
those I hold dear?” he cried in an agony of grief
and remorse. “Bitterly am I atonin’ for my act
o’ imprudence; an exile, a failure,” he gave a mirthless
little laugh; “aye, a failure, for e’en the hopes
of success held out to me have a’ vanished in disappointment.
Oblivion has enveloped me in its darkening
pall, for whichever way I turn naught but
darkest gloom, with not e’en a ray of light, meets
my wretched gaze.” A flash of lightning pierced
the darkness, followed shortly by a heavy, prolonged
roll of thunder. She nestled closer to his
side.</p>

<p>“Be not discouraged, laddie,” she said; “’tis always
darkest before dawn, an’ who kens what may
yet happen?”</p>

<p>“Ah, nae, nae,” he interrupted with a despairing
shake of his head, “e’en the elements conspire against
me, for I maun face this coming storm on foot to
reach Greenock. ’Tis all a part of my just punishment.”
The wind had risen and with it a driving mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
which soon enveloped them in its damp embrace. But
they heeded it not.</p>

<p>“Bide a wee, dinna go to-night,” she pleaded,
while the wind tossed her tangled curls seductively
around his neck and in his sorrowing face. “Listen
to the wind. Oh,’tis a bad night to start on a journey,”
and she clung to him tighter, her skirts flapping
about his limbs like some live thing, thrilling
him by their touch.</p>

<p>“Before ye came out, lassie,” he replied quietly,
stilling the tumult in his heart, “I wrote some verses
in this book as a parting song; how appropriate they
are for this occasion ye will see. Listen,” and holding
the book up to the light he began to read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The gloomy night is gathering fast,</div>
<div class="verse">Loud roars the wild inconstant blast;</div>
<div class="verse">Yon murky cloud is foul with rain,</div>
<div class="verse">I see it driving o’er the plain;</div>
<div class="verse">Chill runs my blood to hear it rave,</div>
<div class="verse">I think upon the stormy wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Where many a danger I must dare,</div>
<div class="verse">Far from the bonnie banks of Ayr;</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis not the surging billows’ roar,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis not that fatal deadly shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Tho’ death in every shape appear,</div>
<div class="verse">The wretched have no more to fear;</div>
<div class="verse">But round my heart the ties are bound,</div>
<div class="verse">That heart transpierced with many a wound;</div>
<div class="verse">These bleed afresh, these ties I tear,</div>
<div class="verse">To leave the bonnie banks of Ayr.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wind had risen rapidly and the old beech tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was shrieking and groaning overhead as its branches
strove like maniac arms with the tempest. The Ayr
could be plainly heard roaring its diapason on its
rocky banks in the darkness below, while the thunder
crashed overhead and the lurid glare of lightning
ever and again lit up the yard.</p>

<p>Unheeding its warning he continued, his melancholy
sonorous voice, with its mournful cadences,
floating out with passionate longing, filling his listener
with unutterable sadness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Farewell, old Coila’s hills and dales,</div>
<div class="verse">Her heathy moors and winding vales;</div>
<div class="verse">The scenes where wretched fancy roves,</div>

<div class="verse">My peace with thee, my love with those;</div>
<div class="verse">The bursting tears my heart declare,</div>
<div class="verse">Farewell the bonnie banks of Ayr.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As his voice died away he heard the sound of
sobbing, and looked up, to see his mother standing in
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Come awa’, lad, come in out of the night air!”
she called tenderly, controlling her sobs.</p>

<p>Silently they entered the cottage. Robert crossed
the room to his brother’s side.</p>

<p>“Gilbert,” he said quietly, “ye take the songs an’
verses ye will find on my table an’ send them to Mr.
Aiken. Mayhap they will bring you in a bit o’ money
to help ye in your struggle wi’ poverty, an’ forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
me that I maun leave ye to battle wi’ misfortune
alone.” Turning to Mary he continued, lovingly,
“Mary, lass, will ye accept my Bible as a parting
gift?” She looked at him with shining eyes. “Ye’ll
find it in the oak box with the glass lid in the attic.”</p>

<p>“I’ll prize it for aye, Robert,” she sobbed gratefully,
pressing his hand, “an’ our prayers will follow
ye to that far distant land, where I hope
success awaits ye.”</p>

<p>He drew her to him gently and pressed a kiss on
her pure brow. “Farewell, lassie, may ye be happy,”
he breathed fervently. Turning again to Gilbert
he spoke rapidly, “Farewell, brother, give my love
to the dear brothers an’ sisters when they come hame.”
He shook his hand warmly.</p>

<p>“God keep ye, Robert,” answered Gilbert quietly.</p>

<p>Gently Robert drew his weeping mother into his
arms. Tenderly he pulled down the apron which
she had flung over her head to hide her sorrow, and
wiped away her tears. “Noo, mother,” he whispered
brokenly, “I—I maun say good-by; the day
has drawn to its close an’ I maun start on my journey
to Greenock. Dinna greet, dear mither.” He let
her weep on unconstrainedly a few moments.</p>

<p>Finally her bitter sobbing ceased and looking up
into his face she cried passionately, “I canna give
ye up, my son, never to see ye again.” She took
his cheeks lovingly between her hands.</p>

<p>“Ye’re making it hard for me to go, mither,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he cried, utterly distracted. “But the die is cast,
my hands are on the plow, an’ I canna turn back
noo. Ye ken there is naught but disappointment
an’ disgrace to look forward to here, an’——”
Suddenly a loud cheer from outside the cottage
interrupted him. They listened in silent wonder.
Above the noise of the wind, which had risen to a
gale, and the swish of the rain, which now beat in
swirling gusts about the cottage, came the voices of
Souter and Donald shouting and cheering like boys
on a frolic. Quickly they opened the door. A gust
of wind dashed the rain fiercely in their faces.
Through the mist and gloom they could vaguely make
out the outlines of a coach standing at the gate,
which had approached unheard in the storm.</p>

<p>“Robert, Robert!” cried Souter, looming up out
of the darkness and looking decidedly weatherbeaten.
“’Tis news I have, great and glorious
news.”</p>

<p>“News?” they all repeated in wonder.</p>

<p>“What is it, mon?” asked Rob, trembling with
excitement.</p>

<p>“It can speak for itsel’,” replied Souter gleefully,
“for here it is.” He pointed behind him. They
looked down the path and saw rapidly approaching
the door a tall man, enveloped in a long cloak,
escorted by a servant in livery. At that moment the
light fell on his wet face and they started forward in
amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord Glencairn?” cried Robert incredulously,
his heart throbbing with a strange new-born hope.</p>

<p>“Aye, my lad, and near drowned,” laughed the
visitor genially. Robert grasped his outstretched
hand and drew him to the door.</p>

<p>With words of welcome and delight they made
room for him to enter. Quickly he removed his wet
cloak from his shoulders and threw it to his servant,
who hung it beside the fire, while descanting on the
inclemency of the weather. Nervously and anxiously
they waited for the great man to speak his errand.</p>

<p>Presently he turned from the fireplace, and, addressing
Robert, he said brightly, “Well, Mr. Burns,
you see I have not forgotten you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord,” faltered Robert, his face white
with suppressed feeling, “I—I had despaired of
seein’ you mair; do ye—bring me—hope? Is it—am
I——” his faltering voice stopped abruptly, but
his eager eyes continued to search the noble face
which was looking so kindly into his, as if he would
draw the news from him.</p>

<p>“It is good news,” answered Lord Glencairn,
smiling brightly, “and you are famous; yes, my
lad, your poems are at last published and already
have become the rage in Edinburgh; the name of
Robert Burns is on the tongue of all, high and low,
prince and peasant.”</p>

<p>“Thank God,” cried Mary softly, a look of
rapture on her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burns turned excitedly to her son, her hands
clasped nervously. “Oh, laddie, laddie, ye’re a great
mon, noo!” she exclaimed proudly.</p>

<p>For a moment Robert stood there speechless, a
look of incredulous wonder on his face. “My
lord,” he faltered at last, “can it be true, what
you’re telling me, that my songs are—accepted, read
an’—praised in Edinburgh?” Lord Glencairn
bowed. “Oh, sir,” he continued, with a nervous
catch in his voice, “it seems too good to be true, too
good.”</p>

<p>Gradually the warm color came back to the pale
face, the hurried breathing, which seemed almost to
smother him, became calmer, the nervous, excited
tension relaxed, and, with a smile of rapture and
content on his upturned face, he exclaimed fervently,
“At last my hopes and ambitions are realized, the
bright sunlight of success has crowned my efforts;
my verses are known an’ loved in Edinburgh! Oh,
do ye hear that, my loved ones?” He stretched
out his arms lovingly to them. “Nae mair poverty
for us noo, mither, nae—nor disappointments.”
He turned to Lord Glencairn, who was being assisted
into his cloak. “Oh, sir, I canna tell ye what is in
my heart,” he continued earnestly, “but ’tis overflowing
wi’ love an’ gratitude to ye.”</p>

<p>“There, there, my lad, time is precious,” replied
Lord Glencairn kindly, buttoning up his cloak.
“’Tis late and we have far to go and the postchaise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
is awaiting us. I came here not only to bring you
news, Mr. Burns, but to take you back with me to
Edinburgh.” He laughed heartily at the look of
startled amazement that appeared on the faces before
him.</p>

<p>“To Edinburgh!” gasped Robert unbelievingly.</p>

<p>“Aye, lad,” replied his lordship earnestly, his
eyes flashing with admiration for the modest young
genius. “To Edinburgh, where fame and fortune
await you, where society stands with outstretched
arms to receive you as a conquering hero come to
claim his own. To the capital city, where all unite
in paying homage to the wonderful genius of Robert
Burns, our Scottish Bard. Will you come?” and
he held out his hand invitingly to the wondering lad,
who was gazing at him, his soul in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming?” he cried slowly, looking about
him for some confirmation of his fears. “Go to
Edinburgh wi’ ye, sir, as the Bard of Scotland?
O God, can this be true? My wildest hopes ne’er
held out such dreams o’ greatness, such happiness.”
His voice vibrated with feeling. He paused and took
a deep breath, then he continued joyfully, all the sorrows
of the past forgotten in his excitement, “A few
moments ago, my lord, I was bidding farewell to
these, my loved ones, forever. I was about to start
for the Indies, a wretched exile, a disappointed failure,
and noo fate once mair alters my destiny.”
With a glad laugh he seized Lord Glencairn’s outstretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hand, and, turning to his loved ones, he
cried, his voice ringing out clear and strong, a
conscious thrill of pride running through it, “Nae
more tears, mither, except those of happiness, nae
more sorrow or care, for I can leave ye all wi’ a light
heart noo, wi’ joy instead o’ sadness. ’Tis true
I go from here an outcast, but I’ll return to ye
a hero.”</p>

<h2>BOOK II</h2>

<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>The scene that opened on our hero in Edinburgh
was altogether new, and in a variety of other respects
highly interesting, especially to one of his
disposition of mind. To use an expression of his
own, he “found himself suddenly translated from
the veriest shades of life,” into the presence, and
indeed into the society, of a number of persons
previously known to him by report as of the highest
distinction in his country. From those men of letters
in general his reception was particularly flattering.
And they interested themselves collectively
and individually in the cultivation of his genius.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh literature and fashionable society
are a good deal mixed. Our Bard was an acceptable
guest in the gayest and most elevated circles, and received
from female beauty and elegance those flattering
attentions above all others most grateful to
him. A taste for letters is not always conjoined
with habits of temperance and regularity, and Edinburgh
at this period contained perhaps an uncommon
proportion of men of considerable talents, devoted
to social excesses, in which their talents were
wasted and debased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert entered into several parties of this description
with his usual vehemence. His generous
affections, his ardent eloquence, his brilliant and daring
imagination fitted him to be the idol of such
associations. The sudden alteration of his habits
of life operated on him physically as well as morally.
The humble fare of the Ayrshire peasant he had
exchanged for the luxuries of the Scottish metropolis,
and naturally the effect of this change could not
be inconsiderable. He saw the danger, and at times
formed resolutions to guard against it, but he had embarked
on the tide of dissipation and was borne along
its stream. Some six months after his triumphant entrance
into the city he had returned to Mossgiel for
a fleeting visit to his home, and to assist his brother,
who had taken upon himself the entire support of
their aged mother, and who was struggling with
many difficulties on the farm of Mossgiel. It will
easily be conceived with what pleasure and pride
he was received by his mother, his sisters, and brothers.
He had left them poor and friendless; he
returned to them high in public estimation and easy
circumstances. He returned to them unchanged in
his ardent affections, and ready to share with them
to the uttermost farthing the pittance that fortune
had bestowed. He had been keenly disappointed
not to find Mary there. He learned, to his sorrow,
that she had gone back to the Highlands shortly
after he left for Edinburgh. He felt that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
lost to him now forever, for, while his heart prompted
him to hurry to her side, reason told him that the
visit would but fill her cup of sorrow to the brim.
For, believing as he did, that he was still bound to
Jean in spite of the destruction of her marriage
lines, he knew he would only have to part from her
again, to leave her there with her sad thoughts, her
loneliness, while he returned to the gay life, where
it was so easy to forget or at least to still the voice
of sorrow. Having remained with them a few days
he proceeded again to Edinburgh, first stopping off
at Mauchline to call at the home of Squire Armour,
only to be met with curses and to be driven from
the door by the stern, unyielding man.</p>

<p>Robert returned to Edinburgh, his heart filled
with bitterness and sorrow. For a while he brooded
over his troubles, which threatened to plunge him
into a state of extreme melancholy. But at last resentment
and anger crowded out all other thoughts,
and it was not long before he succeeded in drowning
recollection in the midst of the society and dissipation
of the metropolis.</p>

<p>A year passed by, during which time he had vainly
tried to get word to Jean Armour. He had heard
that she had given birth to twins, and the thought
that they were without the protection of a father’s
name filled him with grief and remorse. Time and
again he had written her, only to have his letters returned
unopened. Finally he had received a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from her father, stating that “the children were
dead and that Jean had quite forgotten him, and
was about to be joined in wedlock with a neighboring
rich farmer; that now he hoped Robert would
leave him and his daughter in peace,” etc., etc. He
laid down the letter with a thrill of joy stirring his
blood. Free at last! He had done his duty as
a man of honor, and now, after all the bitter heartache
and the long separation, he was free to marry
his little sweetheart. “Oh, thank God!” he cried
aloud, in an ecstasy of joy. “Thank God, the
miserable tangle in our lives will soon be straightened.”
He had long entertained a desire to visit those
parts of his native country which were so celebrated
in the rural songs of Scotland, and he would now
gratify that desire with Mary’s home as the objective
point. As soon as arrangements could be
made he started for the Highlands on horseback,
accompanied by a friend, one Will Nichol, and,
his fame having preceded him, they were royally entertained
on their journey through the country.
Finally they arrived in Dornoch, where Mary was
living quietly with her sister, and soon the long parted
lovers were clasped in each other’s arms. Later that
day he told her the glorious news of his release, his
freedom from all ties, told her of his undying love,
and swore that never again should they be parted in
this life. And Mary with a prayer of thankfulness
in her faithful heart, blushingly gave her willing consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to a speedy marriage. The next day they all
returned by easy stages to Edinburgh. Mrs. Dunlop,
an old friend of Robert’s, took the country
maiden under her protecting wing and gave her a
home until the marriage could be solemnized, the date
having been set one month from the time of their
arrival.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p>John Anderson, the proprietor of the “Bull’s
Head,” stood gazing wrathfully upon the scene of
disorder which met his eyes as he opened the door
of the sitting-room of his distinguished lodger’s
apartments. It was early evening, and still that
lodger remained in bed, although he had been called
at different intervals throughout the day by the
irate, though kind-hearted, landlord himself. “Dear—dear—dear,”
he muttered to himself, as he arranged
the furniture, “I’ll just give Robbie a bit
o’ my mind.” He went to the door of the sleeping
apartment and looked in. “Sleepin’ like a bairn,”
he said softly, “an’—an’ wi’ his boots on. Ma
certie!” He raised his hands in horror. “Weel,
I’m glad ye’re nae under the bed. Ah, weel, young
blood must hae its course. I mind I was young mysel’,
an’ if I do say it I could drink mair whusky than
any mon in the toon. Oh, those were happy days,”
and he sang softly to himself, as he continued his work
about the room:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“We are na fou’</div>
<div class="verse">We’re nat that fou’,</div>
<div class="verse">But just a droppie in our ee.</div>
<div class="verse">The cock may craw,</div>
<div class="verse">The day may daw’,</div>
<div class="verse">An’ ay we’ll taste the barley bree.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>A knock on the door interrupted his song.</p>

<p>“Weel, who is it?” he called impatiently.</p>

<p>“Open the door,” replied a female voice eagerly.</p>

<p>“A lassie,” exclaimed John in amazement. “Oh,
Robbie, ye devil.” He swung open the door and
stood back to allow the gorgeously dressed lady to
enter the room. Her dress of rich purple brocaded
silk, cut in the extreme of fashion, rustled stiffly
over the polished floor. Her head with its powdered
wig was held haughtily erect as she surveyed the
room with sparkling black eyes that nervously took
in her surroundings, through the tiny holes in the
black mask which concealed her face.</p>

<p>“I—I thought—isn’t Mr. Burns at home?” she
stammered uneasily.</p>

<p>“Weel, what may ye be wantin’ wi’ Mr. Burns?”
asked John cautiously. He had been bothered to
death with answering the questions of the silly
women who flocked to the parlors of the inn in
hopes of seeing their idol.</p>

<p>The lady turned on him sharply. “None of your
business, my good man,” she retorted haughtily.
“How dare you question me, sirrah?”</p>

<p>John was quite taken aback by the imperious tones,
but he still had his suspicions. “Weel, I thought
perhaps ye were one o’ the artless bonnie wenches
who were here last night wi’ the lads makin’ merry
till the wee sma’ hours. If ye are——” he paused
significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>She flashed him an angry look. “Make your mind
easy on that score, my good fellow,” she retorted icily.
“I have called to interview Mr. Burns on an important
matter. Is he at home?”</p>

<p>“Aye; he is in there asleep,” replied John, pointing
to a door beside the large book cabinet, which
nearly occupied one side of the room.</p>

<p>“Asleep!” she repeated incredulously. “Lud, he
retires uncommon early for a gallant,” and there
was a note of disappointment in her deep contralto
voice.</p>

<p>“Early is it?” said John, with a knowing smile.
“Faith, he hasna been up this day.”</p>

<p>“What?” she ejaculated in horror. “Not all
day? Then you must awaken him immediately. I
must have speech with him at once,” and she spread
her voluminous draperies over the wide lounge and
calmly seated herself. “Do you hear?” she cried
impatiently, as John made no move.</p>

<p>“I hae excellent hearin’, mum,” replied John
carelessly, “but I ken when I’m well off, an’ I hae
nae desire to feel the toe o’ Robert’s boot.”</p>

<p>“A pest on your stubbornness, fool,” she cried
angrily, springing to her feet.</p>

<p>“An’ I hae my doubts o’ a lass who comes to a
mon’s lodgings at night,” continued John, resenting
her impatience. “It’s na respectable.”</p>

<p>She looked him over insolently, then shrugged her
shoulders. “I protest, landlord,” she replied, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a mocking tone, “I am quite respectable, even if
I am here unchaperoned. But, Lud, I like not conventionalities,
and this adventure suits my madcap spirit
well.” She walked to the door of the sleeping chamber
and was about to open it, when his voice arrested
her.</p>

<p>“I ken it all the time,” he cried indignantly.
“Ye’re a brazen hussy.”</p>

<p>“Landlord!” she gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p>“An’ ye can leave my inn,” continued John, now
thoroughly aroused. “We are respectable, if ye
are na.”</p>

<p>“Peace, fool!” she exclaimed furiously. “I am
Lady Glen——” she stopped and bit her lips angrily
at the indiscreet slip of her tongue. Suddenly a
daring thought entered her mind. One glance at his
face told her that he had not caught the name. To
think was to act with my lady. Then she continued
glibly, “I am Lady Nancy Gordon, daughter of the
Duke of Gordon, of Gordon Castle. It will be all
over town in a day,” she thought with malicious
satisfaction.</p>

<p>John staggered back as though he had been shot.
“Ye Lady Nancy?” he gasped in amazement. “Oh,
my lady, I ask your pardon.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not easily granted, numskull,” replied the
imperious beauty, her black eyes flashing dangerously.
The sound of a carriage rolling over the
cobble stones suddenly arrested her attention. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a moment she listened intently, then, with a startled
exclamation, she turned to John and said in a frightened
whisper, “’Fore heaven! if it should be my husband—my
father, I mean, in pursuit of me.” She
ran hastily to the window from where a view of the
street could be obtained and threw open the casement.</p>

<p>“It would serve ye right, my lady,” said John
to himself.</p>

<p>“Great heavens! ’tis my uncle, Sir William
Creech!” she gasped. Then she said aloud, “Landlord,
’tis my father, as I feared! Oons! what a scrape
I’m in.” She closed the shutter hastily.</p>

<p>“’Twill ruin your reputation to be found here
at night, my lady,” cried John concernedly, trotting
nervously to the window.</p>

<p>“O Lud,” she replied airily, “I’m not concerned
over my reputation, ’tis already torn to ribbons by
my dear friends. ’Tis my—my father’s wrath I
fear. He is like to do some mischief.” An imperious
knocking sounded on the door below.</p>

<p>“He has found ye, lassie,” cried old John excitedly.
“Go down to him; dinna let him find ye
here in Robbie’s chamber. Ye ken the blame will
all fall on the lad,” and he sought to escort her to
the door, but she evaded his outstretched hand with
laughing unconcern.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my good fellow. I protest, I will not
see him,” she exclaimed, with reckless abandon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
She would keep up the impersonation till the end.
Another such chance to blast her enemy’s reputation
would not come to her in a lifetime, she thought
wickedly. “Listen,” she cried impetuously. “My
father, the Duke of Gordon, while he admires the
poetry of Mr. Burns, does not admire the man himself,
consequently he did not send him an invitation
to attend the masked ball which is given at Gordon
Castle to-night,” she explained glibly. “’Twas a
monstrous insult to the Bard of Scotland, and I told
my father so, and that I would not countenance it.
Then I stole away, as I thought, unobserved, and came
here to induce Mr. Burns to return with me. Once
inside the castle my father will be forced to receive
him graciously. Now, hurry, landlord, tell him to
dress and we’ll slip out quietly, and, with your connivance,
elude my—father’s vigilance.” She watched
him narrowly to note the effect of her story.</p>

<p>“My lady,” replied John proudly, “the lad goes
to Athol Castle to-night, so ye had better gang hame
wi’ your father.” She gave a quick start of delighted
satisfaction. So he was going after all. If
she had only known that and felt sure of it, she might
have spared herself this nerve-racking experiment,
she thought impatiently.</p>

<p>The pounding had kept up incessantly, and now
a stern, commanding voice called out for the landlord.</p>

<p>“He’s calling me,” said John nervously; “ye’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
better go doon an’ explain a’ to him,” he told
her pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Landlord, where the devil are you?” They
could hear the heavy tread of feet walking about
the rooms below.</p>

<p>“He’s inside the house,” whispered John, wringing
his hands.</p>

<p>“O Lud, he seems most angry, doesn’t he?” she
said in a subdued voice. She had suddenly grown
tired of the deception, and was eager now to get
away. “I—I think perhaps ’twould be best if he—er—my
father didn’t find me here after all,” she
admitted. “I—I really dare not face his anger.”
She jumped up quickly, all her bravado vanished.
“Get me out of this place, landlord, quick, quick!”
she gasped, clinging to him. Oh, why had she come?
Sir William would make such a disagreeable scene
if he found her here.</p>

<p>“Into that room wi’ ye!” cried John quickly,
pointing to a small door in the opposite side of
the room; “an’ I’ll get your father out o’ the
house.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t the old fossil have stayed at
home?” she said to herself angrily. “This promised
to be such a romantic adventure, landlord,” she said
aloud, poutingly. “And now ’tis all spoiled. Plague
take it. Hurry, landlord, and get my—father away,
for I must return to the ball before my absence is
noticed.” She went into the room, her heart filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with apprehension, and closed the door, which John
promptly locked.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord,” he muttered with a sigh of
relief. “I breathe easier.” Going to the door leading
to the hall, he listened for a moment. From
below came the sound of clinking glasses. He closed
the door quickly. The coast was clear now. His
guidwife was waiting on the customer. He hurried
across the room and was about to release his prisoner,
when he heard the door of Robert’s chamber open.
He turned quickly and found his lodger yawning in
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Well, John Anderson, my Jo John,” said he
lazily, “what’s all the row here, eh?”</p>

<p>John looked up guiltily. “Are ye up, laddie?”
he stammered.</p>

<p>“Nay, John, I’m walkin’ round in my bed,” retorted
Robert dryly. “Dinna ye think it’s time for
me to be up?” he asked. “What’s the matter, mon?
stand still, ye make me dizzy.”</p>

<p>John was uneasily walking up and down, casting
surreptitious glances at the door of the room which
held the fair captive. “Oh, Johnny, my Jo John,”
laughed Robert as he caught sight of the old man’s
lugubrious countenance, “ye’ve been drinkin’ too
much Usqubaugh.”</p>

<p>“Too much what, Robbie?” he asked nervously.</p>

<p>“Usqubaugh. Dinna ken what that is? It’s
whisky, whisky, whisky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I ken, laddie,” replied John, smiling grimly.
“Ye needna’ repeat it; one whisky is enough.”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” laughed Robert, slapping him on
the shoulder. “Ye dinna ken my capacity.” The
noise of a chair overturning in the next room arrested
his attention.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s n—nothing,” stammered John.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody in that room,” exclaimed Rob,
putting his ear to the crack in the door. “I hear
her walking around.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Rob, it’s nobody,” protested John,
pushing him away.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, John Anderson, my Jo John!” cried
Rob, pointing an accusing finger at the flushed,
embarrassed face of the old man, “I’m on to
ye.”</p>

<p>“For shame, Robbie, an’ me wi’ an old wife below
stairs,” he answered indignantly.</p>

<p>“Faith, I’ll just find out who it is,” chuckled Rob,
going toward the door.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, lad!” remonstrated John, holding him
back. “Wait, I’ll tell ye who it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew it,” ejaculated Rob triumphantly.
“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s the Bailie,” faltered John.</p>

<p>“The Bailie? what’s he doing in there?”</p>

<p>“Weel, he—he came to arrest ye for debt,” glibly
lied the old man. “So I told him to wait in there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
till ye came hame, an’ noo he’s my prisoner; that’s a’,
Robbie.”</p>

<p>Rob grasped his hand gratefully. “Ye’re a true
friend, John Anderson. Let me see, how much do I
owe him?”</p>

<p>John backed quickly away from him. “Nay, nay,
laddie!” he said decidedly. “I havena anither
penny.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” laughed Rob ruefully. “So
I’ll leave ye to get him out the best way ye can; he’s
your prisoner, not mine. I’d like to pitch him down
stairs. Come on, John, between us we ought to manage
the old Shylock.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Robbie,” he retorted dryly. “Take
my word for it, we’d hae our hands full.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I’ll get into the rest of my clothes, for I’m
due in society,” yawned Rob, going to his room.
“Get rid of him, John; do what ye like with him;
he’s no friend of mine,” and he went in and closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>John softly followed him to the door and turned
the key in the lock. “I’ll take nae chances,” he said
grimly.</p>

<p>“Good-evening,” said a sweet voice timidly. He
turned around and with a gasp of astonishment
beheld a young girl standing in the doorway. Suddenly
he gave a great start. Could his eyes deceive
him? Was that beautiful creature in the long white
opera cloak, her golden locks piled in a gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
mass high upon her little head, really the barefooted
lass he had seen only a few days ago, in her short
skirt of plaid?</p>

<p>“Mary Campbell, is it yoursel’, lass?” he finally
gasped.</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis really me,” laughed Mary happily.
“I’m goin’ to the ball at Athol Castle with Mrs.
Dunlop. I wanted Robbie to see me in my gown
before I went, so Mrs. Dunlop left me here, while she
drove over to pick up Mrs. McLehose; then she’ll
return for me. Where is Robbie, John?”</p>

<p>“He’s in there dressing, Mary, but whist, I’ve
something to tell ye first.”</p>

<p>“About Robbie?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Aye, there’s the devil to pay here, Mary.” The
old man’s face looked gloomy and perturbed.
“There’s a—a lady in that room.”</p>

<p>“A—a lady!” gasped Mary in amazement, looking
at the door of Robbie’s chamber.</p>

<p>“Aye, Lady Nancy Gordon hersel’.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s true,” cried Mary, sinking into a
chair, a great fear tugging at her heart. “It’s
true, then, all the stories I hear, that Robert is be—bewitched
wi’ her. I wouldna’ believe it before.
Mrs. Dunlop says it isna’ true, that Robbie hasna’
changed, but noo what can I think? Oh, laddie, oh,
laddie!” and she sank back pale and trembling.</p>

<p>“There, lassie, Robert doesna’ care a penny for
that lass,” he said tenderly. “She is only a heartless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
coquette, o’er fond of adventure,” and he laid
his wrinkled hand caressingly on the golden head.
“Noo look here, Mary, ye mustna’ expect Robert
to be an angel all the time. He thinks only
of ye, and he loves ye just as fondly, e’en if
he does smile and make love to the ladies who
throw themsel’s at his feet. He would lose his
popularity, ye ken. ’Tis only an amusin’ pastime,
lassie, an’ but gives him inspiration for his
poetry, so dinna’ take it to heart. Ye ken Rob is
highly sensitive, a most temperamental lad, who is
very susceptible to the charms of the fair sex, but
whist, Mary, he isn’t marrying any of them. There
is only one lassie who will be his wife noo, and she’s
nae far away from me this moment.” And he nodded
his head sagely.</p>

<p>“Why dinna’ they leave him alone?” sighed Mary
disconsolately. “’Tis very unmaidenly in them to
seek for his favor so openly.”</p>

<p>“Noo, lassie,” said John seriously, “we maun
get Lady Nancy out o’ this scrape, for the house
is watched noo by her father, who suspects her presence
here.”</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room for a few
moments plunged in deep thought. All at once his
face brightened.</p>

<p>“I have thought o’ a scheme, lassie,” he said suddenly.
“Let Lady Nancy take this long cloak of
yours; ’twill cover her o’er entirely; then she can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
walk boldly out past her father; he will think ’tis
ye, Mary, and will na’ stop her. Ye’re both of a
height,” and he regarded her with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“Why should I help her?” said Mary, her heart
still heavy and sore.</p>

<p>“For Robbie’s sake,” pleaded John. “Her father
will blame the lad for it all; perhaps he will shoot
him, and he an innocent man. Why, lassie, he
doesna’ even ken the lass is in the house.”</p>

<p>“Doesna’ ken it?” repeated Mary, smiling incredulously.
“Why, John, Robert isna’ blind. If
she is in his room——”</p>

<p>“But she isna’ in his room, Mary,” interrupted
John. “She’s in there, scared to death,” and he
pointed to the door opposite.</p>

<p>“Oh!” comprehended Mary with a sigh of relief.
“That’s different. I’ll help her noo, John,” and
she jumped eagerly to her feet, her face flushed and
earnest.</p>

<p>“That’s the girlie,” replied John heartily. Going
to the door, he opened it and whispered to Lady
Nancy to come out.</p>

<p>“Lud, I thought you were never coming,” she
flashed as she hastily entered the room. She stopped
short upon seeing Mary.</p>

<p>“This lady will help ye get away,” said John,
looking angrily at the bogus Lady Nancy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Mary quickly divested herself of her mantle and threw it about
the bare shoulders of the disdainful lady.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Where have I seen that face before?” Lady
Glencairn asked herself nervously, looking closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
into Mary’s flushed, innocent face, that reminded
her so guiltily of Lady Nancy Gordon herself.</p>

<p>Mary quickly divested herself of her mantle and
threw it about the bare shoulders of the disdainful
lady, who hastily drew the large hood over her elaborate
court wig, entirely concealing it within its
voluminous folds.</p>

<p>With a quick careless word of thanks to Mary, she
walked to the door, and calling to John, who was
quietly turning the key in Robert’s door, to show
her the way out, she swiftly left the room, and with
wildly beating heart, passed her uncle at the outer
door, and mingled her presence with the stream of
gallant courtiers and laughing, gayly-dressed ladies
that wended its boisterous way along the crowded
thoroughfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p>When Mary found herself alone she sat down pensively
in the big leather chair, feeling very sad and
thoughtful. Of course she trusted Robert absolutely,
but how could he really love such an ignorant little
country girl like herself, when there were so many
grand, rich, beautiful ladies surrounding him all the
time and suing for his favors, even seeking him out
in his own rooms? But her face brightened as she
thought of what John had told her. “It isna’ his
fault if the women lose their hearts over him,” he had
said, and in her heart she felt she could not blame
anyone for loving Robbie. She rose and softly approached
his door. Then she paused. No, she would
wait till he came and found her himself. But she did
wish he would hurry and finish dressing before Mrs.
Dunlop came back. She strolled aimlessly about the
room looking with listless eyes at the collections of
souvenirs and bric-a-brac which filled the mantels and
covered the tables. She noted with wonder the profusion
of ladies’ gloves, ’kerchief, scarfs, a slipper or
two and a motley collection of other articles littering
the table. She picked up a beautiful pink mask and
idly turned it over; on the back she read, “Dropped
by Lady Nancy at the Charity Ball given in honor
of the Prince of Wales.” She put it down, her lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
trembling. He must prize it very highly, she
thought with a pang of jealousy; but as she read
the various inscriptions on the back of a number of
the others, she smiled and told herself what a silly she
was. Of course he couldn’t be in love with all the
owners of those many favors. She picked up the
mask again and held it before her eyes. How funny
to cover one’s face in such a manner, she thought.
She fastened the elastic behind her ear, and with
a woman’s curiosity wondered how she looked
in it. She quickly spied the large cheval mirror
in the cabinet. “How funny I do look,” she
said to herself with a little amused laugh, as
she caught sight of her reflection. “Nobody would
ever know me.” As she drew closer to the mirror
in pleased wonder her dancing eyes slowly wandered
from the top of the glittering coil of her
golden hair, dwelt for an instant in blushing
modesty on the gleaming, bare shoulders, and rested
in loving, blissful content on her simple trailing robe
of ivory-tinted embroidered silk. She looked angelically
lovely as she stood there innocently admiring
her winsome reflection.</p>

<p>“Is that really the Highland Mary who used to
wander barefooted through the glens and vales, the
simple dairymaid who made butter for Colonel
Montgomery?” she asked herself dreamily. “Am
I awake, I wonder? How Souter Johnny would
open his eyes if he could only see me noo in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
beautiful gown, carrying a fan an’ wi’ my hair done
up high.” She laughed gleefully but softly at the
thought. “Wouldna’ they be proud to see me such a
grand lady.” She walked stiffly across the room
with all the dignity she could command, her
chin held high and taking quick little pleased
glances over her shoulder at her reflection. It was
Mary’s first long gown, and it was not to be wondered
at, when in turning quickly around a chair she
easily became entangled in her train, and with a little
frightened gasp she suddenly found herself on her
knees endeavoring to extricate her feet from the
clinging mass of silk and linen in which they were
enmeshed. Finally she succeeded in regaining her
feet, but not until she had with extreme care seated
herself did she breathe a sigh of relief. She eyed her
train ruefully. “If I should fall doon before all
the great people at the ball, I should be so ashamed,”
she said, sighing dismally. “They would all laugh
at me. But Robert says I am nicer than anyone in
all the world.” She reveled in that thought an instant,
then her face lengthened. “But I ken there
is a difference, a great difference; I am only a simple
country lass without any learnin’ whatever, while
Lady Nancy is——” she rose suddenly as a thought
occurred to her, her hands clasped tightly together.
“Suppose he should grow ashamed of his ignorant
little country wife,” she whispered with trembling
lips; “it would break my heart in twain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>She held out her hands passionately toward her
unseen lover. “Ye willna’ ever regret makin’ me
your wife, will ye dear?” she whispered imploringly.
“Ye willna’ be sorry in years to come.” Quickly
her loving, trustful faith reasserted itself. “Nay,
nay, my heart tells me ye willna’, so I’ll be foolish
nae more. I’ll tell him what a silly lass I’ve been an’
how he’ll laugh at my doubting fears.” She took a
step toward his door, when it opened and Robert came
quickly into the room, dressed for the ball, looking
very handsome in his plain and unpretending dress of
blue homespun, for he still retained the same simplicity
of manner and appearance that he brought with
him from the country. He stopped in amazement
as he came face to face with his unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>Mary with a thrill of joy at the sight of her lover
waited eagerly for the words of praise which she
knew her appearance would elicit, and for which she
hungered, but as he stood looking at her so calmly,
so coldly, her joy turned to wonder and fear. What
was the matter? Didn’t she please him? With
a little gasp she put her hand nervously to her
face. As it came in contact with the mask, which
she had forgotten to remove, her heart gave a quick
bound of relief. Of course! He didn’t know her.
“He doesna’ ken who I am at all,” she thought
gleefully.</p>

<p>As his eyes rested upon the pink mask, Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gave a sudden start, then glanced quickly at the
table. No, it wasn’t there. So then this was Lady
Nancy herself. He recognized her hair, her figure,
and above all the mask. “So my haughty lady
thinks it safer to play wi’ fire incognito, eh?”
he thought grimly. “Weel, I’ll teach ye a lesson,
my fine lady; ye need one badly.” Then aloud, “I’m
indeed honored, madam, by your presence here to-night,”
he said, bowing low before her.</p>

<p>Mary courtesied deeply. Oh, it was so exciting to
be talking with her Robbie, and how surprised he
would be when she unmasked.</p>

<p>“Haven’t ye a word to say to me, fair lady?”
continued Robert softly, as she stood silently before
him.</p>

<p>“He’ll sure ken my voice,” she thought in trepidation;
“if I could only talk like a lady.” She wondered
if she could imitate the haughty tones of Lady
Nancy Gordon herself. She’d try. She seated herself
languidly. “Then you don’t recognize me?”
she asked, disguising her lyric voice, as near as possible,
in the lazy drawl of Lady Glencairn’s voice.</p>

<p>He started and looked at her intently. It didn’t
sound like Lady Nancy at all, but who else could
she be? he thought blankly. “Your voice sounds
like—but nae, I maun be mistaken,” he said doubtfully.
“Nay, madam, I do not recognize you. Will
you not remove——”</p>

<p>“What, my face?” laughed Mary. She had marvelously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
lost all trace of her country intonation.
“Oh, nay, sir! I’m too much attached to it.”</p>

<p>“Well ye might be, fair lady!” replied Robert,
“but why do ye hide your beauty so jealously?”
He reached out his hand to lift the mask from her
face, but, with a rippling laugh, she eluded him, and
from behind the high-backed settle made reply.</p>

<p>“Be not impatient, Mr. Burns,” she said saucily;
“you shall see my face in good time, I warrant ye!”
It must be Lady Nancy after all, he told himself.</p>

<p>“’Tis a promise of paradise, madam!” he cried
fervently, entering into the spirit of adventure.</p>

<p>Mary looked at him reproachfully. Did he think
she was really Lady Gordon? she wondered. The
thought gave her pause. Well, she would find out
how much he really cared for her, how much truth
there was in the gossip she had heard. “Rumor
sayeth, Mr. Burns, that ye are in love with the beautiful
Lady Nancy Gordon; is that so?” she asked,
fanning herself languorously.</p>

<p>He smiled quizzically into her face. “Rumor hath
many tongues, fair lady, and most of them lying ones.
The lady doesna’ suit my taste; even her money
couldna’ tempt me, an’ I need the money badly.
That will take her conceit down a peg I’ll warrant,”
he thought grimly.</p>

<p>“But she is very beautiful, I hear,” said Mary,
filled with delight at his answer.</p>

<p>“That I grant ye. Mistress Nancy is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
adept in the use of the hare’s foot an’ of the paint
box. I’ll wager she can teach even our incomparable
actress, Mrs. Siddons, a few tricks in the art of
makeup. Oh, but ye should see the lady in the early
morning. ’Fore heaven, she resembles damaged
goods!” Now would come the explosion of wounded
pride and outraged dignity, he thought calmly, but
his amazement was unbounded when the seeming
Lady Nancy jumped up and down, ecstatically clapping
her hands in a very undignified manner. “Ye
seem o’er pleased at my remark,” he exclaimed with
a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“I am, I am pleased!” she cried joyfully.</p>

<p>“What?” he stammered taken aback—“why, I—I
thought ye were——” He stopped, flushed and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Were Lady Nancy Gordon!” she finished. “O
Lud, if I were, I wouldn’t feel complimented at all the
flattering things I’ve heard!” and she went off in
a peal of merry laughter.</p>

<p>“Who are ye then, who comes to my chamber at
night?” he asked curtly, chagrined at his mistake.
She shook her head and laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Ye shall know in good time,” she replied coquettishly.
“I—I must make certain that ye dinna’ love—me.”
She smiled, but her heart was beating wildly.</p>

<p>“I love only one maiden, an’ I make her my wife
within a week,” he answered with dignity.</p>

<p>“An’ ye’ve no regrets for Lady Nancy, nor for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mrs. McLehose, nor—nor any o’ the grand ladies
ye’ll be givin’ up to marry the little country
maiden?” she asked softly, forgetting in her eagerness
her lapse into her natural speech.</p>

<p>“None, my lady,” he replied firmly. “Noo, lets call
a truce to this masquerade! I am at a loss to understand
your errand here to-night, but do not press
ye for an explanation, and as I am due at the Duke
of Athol’s, I must bid ye good-night.” He bowed
coldly, and started to leave her.</p>

<p>But with a cry of joy, which thrilled him to the
heart, she drew near to him with outstretched arms.
“Robbie, lad, canna’ ye guess who I am?” she
cried. “I’m nae a grand lady at all, I’m only your
Highland Mary.” With a quick movement, she tore
off the mask from her flushed and radiant face and
threw it far from her.</p>

<p>“Mary, is it ye?” he gasped, almost speechless
with surprise. He could scarcely believe his senses.
This radiantly beautiful lady his Highland Mary?
was such a metamorphosis possible?</p>

<p>She made him a little courtesy. “Aye, ’tis
Mary!” she answered, her heart beating fast with
pleasure. Quickly she told him how she had come,
why she had come, and how long she had waited,
just to hear his words of approval. “Do I please
ye, laddie?” she asked shyly.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not speak. Her wonderful
perfection of beauty startled him. He drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
closely into his arms, kissing her with almost
pathetic tenderness. “Mary, my love, my sweet
lass!” and his voice trembled. “Pleased! Good
Heavens, what little words those are to express my
feelings. I can tell ye how you look, for nothing can
ever make ye vain! Ye’re the most beautiful lassie
I’ve ever seen! Ah, but I’m proud of ye this night.
Ye’re fit to wear a coronet, Mary lass! I ken there
will not be a grand lady at the ball to-night who
will look half sae bonnie, nor hae such sweet, dainty
manners, as my country sweetheart.” He held her
off at arm’s length and glanced with affectionate
adoration, from the fair, golden-crowned head down
to the point of the small pearl-embroidered slipper
that peeped beneath the edge of the rich, sheeny
white robe.</p>

<p>“It seems so strange to be here in Edinburgh,
decked out in all this finery,” she murmured dreamily,
“and on my way to a real ball. Is it really me?”</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis ye, Mary, I’ll swear to that!” he cried
heartily, kissing the sweet, ingenuous face raised to
his so wistfully. She blushed with pleasure, and
bashfully turned her head away. “Ye dinna’ think
I look awkward, do ye laddie?” she inquired in a low,
timid voice.</p>

<p>“Nay, ye’re grace itself, sweetheart!” he replied
reassuringly, raising her chin till her drooping eyes
met his.</p>

<p>“An’ ye wouldna ken I was only a dairymaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
if it werena for my speech, would ye?” she interrogated,
with pathetic hopefulness. Her concerned,
anxious little face and wistful manner touched him
deeply.</p>

<p>“I wouldna have ye changed for all the world,
Mary!” he told her tenderly, pressing his lips to the
one little curl which hung unconfined over her snowy
shoulder. “Be your own pure, sweet self always,
for ye’re the fairest of all God’s creatures to me
noo.”</p>

<p>She gave a deep sigh of absolute content, and
leaned against him silently for a moment. Then she
looked up at him brightly. “This fine dress makes
me quite a grand lady, doesna’ it?” she prattled
innocently.</p>

<p>“Aye! every inch a queen!” and he made her a
deep bow.</p>

<p>“But it isna mine, Robbie,” she whispered confidentially.
“I borrowed it for the night only, like
Cinderella in the fairy book, to make my début into
fashionable society,” and she laughed gleefully, like
a little child telling a wonderful secret. “It’s Mrs.
Dunlop’s wedding gown, Robbie; isna it just
sweet?” She passed her hand gently over the folds
of the silk and there was awe and reverence in the
touch. “Oh, how I love to smooth it, ’tis so soft an’
rich an’ glossy; it isna’ wrong to love the beautiful
things, is it, laddie?” she asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Robert, smiling tenderly at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
naïveté. “Love the pretty things all ye like, dearie,
for hereafter ye shall have the finest gowns in town.
Ye shall select whatsoever your fancy pleases—dresses,
bonnets, mits, boots,” and he enumerated
on his fingers all the articles he could remember so
dear to a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>“Shall I really, really?” she gasped as he
finished, looking at him with wondering eyes. “I
hae never bought a pretty thing in a’ my life, ye ken,
an’ oh, won’t it be just sweet? We’ll go to the shops
to-morrow, an’ Mrs. Dunlop will help me select my—my
wedding gown.” She held her head away bashfully,
blushing pink before the sudden fire that
gleamed in the dark eyes bent on her so devotedly.</p>

<p>“Your wedding gown?” he repeated, with dreamy
softness. “Let it be silk, Mary, white, soft and
shimmering, to float around ye like a cloud of sunshine.
An’ ye must have a bridal veil too, lassie, one
sae fine an’ transparent that it will cover ye o’er like
the morning mist.”</p>

<p>“I would be afraid to buy so much,” she replied
gravely. “’Twould be too costly, an’ ye canna’
afford to waste sae much money to deck me out like
a lady,” and she shook her head in firm disapproval.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily at her sober face and air of
housewifely prudence. “My dear,” he whimsically
told her, “dinna’ ye mind the cost. A weddin’
doesna’ often happen in one’s lifetime, sae we’ll make
it a grand one this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye’ll spoil me, Robbie,” she answered, smiling
happily.</p>

<p>“Nay, ye’re too sweet and lovely to be spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye ken,” she replied demurely, “sweet
things spoil the quickest.”</p>

<p>Before he could reply, the rattle of a carriage
over the pavement sounded loudly through the
room. As it stopped at the door, Mary gave a little
sigh of regret. “It’s Mrs. Dunlop, returning for
me at last,” she said. She secretly hoped the sharp
old eyes would not miss the cloak.</p>

<p>“Aye, like the good fairy godmother,” smiled
Robert, as he led her out of the room and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I were in a dream,” she murmured
softly, picking up her train, and lovingly holding it
over her arm, as she walked daintily across the sidewalk
to the waiting carriage. “If I am, laddie,”
she continued earnestly, “I hope I may never awake
from it; I want to dream on forever.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p>When Lady Glencairn, after her arrival at the Duke
of Athol’s, found that Robert had not come—indeed
she and Lord Glencairn and Sir William Creech, her
uncle, had been the first to arrive—she decided recklessly
to visit him at his chambers, so she had easily
stolen away unnoticed by all save one, on her indiscreet
journey. Sir William had seen her as she
slipped guiltily out through the conservatory window
and had followed her with growing suspicions
to the door of Robert’s chamber, where he waited in
impotent wrath for her to reappear, after having
questioned the guidwife within the inn. And he
was not deceived when she came out, wrapped in the
disguising cloak and mask. He followed her like a
grim servitor till she reached the castle, and as she
was noiselessly reëntering by the conservatory window,
he called to her to wait. With a startled gasp
she turned, and as her eyes rested on her uncle’s
accusing face, she gave a little laugh, half scornful,
half defiant, and leisurely throwing off her cloak and
mask, stood waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>“Ye foolish woman!” he told her angrily.
“How could ye be so imprudent, reckless mad, as to
visit a man’s chamber at night?”</p>

<p>“Don’t preach to me, uncle,” she answered sullenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
“No one knows of my being there, not even
Mr. Burns himself.”</p>

<p>“But what were ye thinkin’ of to do such a reprehensible
act?” he demanded sternly. She turned on
him suddenly.</p>

<p>“Because I love him!” she exclaimed passionately,
casting prudence to the winds. “I went there to tell
him of my love, to give myself to him, to beg him to
take me away from here, to take me anywhere, only
to let me be near him, to stay with him. But I was
forced to come away without seeing him, thanks to
you.”</p>

<p>For a moment he regarded the reckless woman in
silence, amazement, shame, and anger struggling for
the mastery.</p>

<p>“Alice, of what are you thinking?” he ejaculated
finally, catching her roughly by the arm. “You
must control yourself. I speak for your own good.
Think no more of this idle poet, for only shame,
ruin and unhappiness can come to ye and your husband,
unless ye give up this unholy passion.”</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully. “My husband!” she
cried bitterly. “Don’t remind me of that fossil!
You, and the rest of my family, are to blame for my
being fettered, tied to a man I do not love. If it
were not for that, I could find the happiness I
crave.”</p>

<p>“Sh! be calm!” he continued, looking anxiously
around. “You may be overheard. Foolish woman!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
do you forget that Robert Burns, as well as yourself,
is married.”</p>

<p>“He is not!” she flashed impetuously. “That
was no legal tie. Some foolish chit of a country lass
flung herself at him, with the usual result. Any
man would have done as he did, but unlike most men,
he, out of pity and from a high sense of honor, married
her; but it was an irregular marriage, which
was speedily annulled by the girl’s father. He is
free now, free as ever he was. The girl has given
him up, poor fool. I only am the shackled one, a
prisoner for life, unless——” An eager light flashed
in her deepened eyes.</p>

<p>“Unless Robert Burns elopes with ye!” he finished
sarcastically. “I warn ye, Alice, not to play with
edged tools;’tis o’er dangerous. Be more careful
or others will suspect what I already know.” She
smiled disdainfully and shrugged her shapely shoulders.</p>

<p>“Do not force me to open your husband’s eyes!”
he retorted, angered by her irritating indifference.
She looked at him, her heart filled with sudden fury.
How she would like to hit him in the face with her
fan, how she hated him and his interference, his
unwelcome advice. “Already,” he continued irritably,
“you have given that scandalmonger, Eppy
McKay, cause to suspect your too warm and ardent
affection for Mr. Burns, by openly showing jealousy
of Lady Nancy Gordon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“I jealous of Nancy Gordon?” she repeated, with
airy scorn, walking toward the door of the conservatory.
“Huh, not I, uncle; I am not so unconscious
of my own charms,” and she drew her magnificent
figure up to its full height, then smiled insolently into
his perturbed and nervous face. “I thank you for
all your advice,” she murmured sweetly as they traversed
the long hall, “but remember, hereafter, that
I mean to steer my own canoe, whether it leads me
into safe waters or through the rapids.” And with
a radiant smile upon her sensuous lips she entered
the drawing-room, leaning affectionately upon the
arm of her outraged but speechless relative. Quietly
she took her place by her waiting husband’s side, her
dark eyes full of a bewitching and dangerous softness,
for her thoughts were on the one guest whose
very name had the power to move her so completely.</p>

<p>Never had she appeared so dazzlingly beautiful, as
she stood there meeting her friends and acquaintances
with a deep ceremonious courtesy for the distinguished
ones, a smile and a nod for her intimates,
and an air of high-bred insolence and extreme self-satisfaction
pervading her whole appearance.</p>

<p>No one was ever bored at the Duchess of Athol’s
brilliant “at homes.” One always felt sure of
meeting at least three or four justly celebrated
personages under her hospitable roof. And to-night
society was a-gog, for it was to welcome the farmer-poet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Robert Burns, who had returned from his
triumphant tour through the Highlands. Soon the
capacious drawing-rooms were crowded. There was
the rustle of silk and satin, rare and delicate perfumes
shaken out of lace kerchiefs, while the heavy
scent of the many bouquets oppressed the warm air
to the point of suffocation. There was an interminably
monotonous murmur of voices, only broken at
rare intervals by a ripple of mild laughter. Over
by the large windows that overlooked the terrace
stood a group of people gazing earnestly out beyond
the gardens at some object, which had arrested their
attention, with various degrees of interest.</p>

<p>“Whatever is happening below on Princes
Street?” suddenly inquired one of the ladies, nervously
clutching the arm of the man nearest her.
Eppy McKay was an eccentric maiden lady of questionable
age and taste. Of more than ordinary
height naturally, she looked a giantess in her powdered
wig, which towered fully a foot in the air, and
which was decorated profusely with waving plumes,
rosettes and jewels. Her lowcut gown of crimson
satin, over a petticoat of quilted green silk, was cut
extremely low, revealing a vision of skin and bones,
powdered to a ghastly whiteness. Her affectations,
her simperings, and her poses accorded society much
amusement, of which fact she was blissfully unconscious.</p>

<p>“There is a crowd gathered around a carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
but farther than that I cannot make out,” replied
Mr. Mackenzie, the famous author and publisher.</p>

<p>A prolonged shout from below increased the restlessness
of the timid Eppy. “Oh, dear!” she gasped.
“If it should be an uprising of the Jacobites,” and
she looked fearfully into the amused faces of her
companions.</p>

<p>With a disgusted grunt, Sir William Creech shook
his arm free from her clawlike clutch. “Nonsense,
woman, ye’re daft!” he answered impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” she murmured in injured
surprise.</p>

<p>“The mob is increasing—’tis coming nearer!”
exclaimed Mr. Mackenzie, stepping out upon the
wide balcony.</p>

<p>“So it is,” affirmed Eppy, retreating behind the
heavy curtains. “Lady Glencairn!” she called as
her ladyship approached the window. “Listen to
those murmurs! Oh, dear! it makes me so nervous.”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn stepped out upon the balcony,
followed by the timid Eppy, and stood contemplating
the scene in the brightly lighted street below
them.</p>

<p>“It sounds not ominous,” she said quietly, after a
moment. “Lud, what a throng! They have unhitched
the horses from a carriage, and are themselves
drawing it hither.”</p>

<p>“Who is in the carriage, can you see?” eagerly
asked Eppy, straining her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“A gentleman, who is evidently addressing the
people,” answered Lady Glencairn slowly. She
gazed intently at the figure silhouetted against the
light of the street lamps. Surely she knew that
form. At that moment he turned, and with a flush
of surprise, a thrill of joy, she suddenly recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Upon my life,’tis Robert, Robert Burns!” she
cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“Aye, I recognize him now,” said Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>“And you say they are drawing him hither?” inquired
Sir William incredulously, turning to his
niece.</p>

<p>“Aye, and why not?” she replied brightly, turning
to the others. “They should carry him on their
shoulders, for he deserves all homage.”</p>

<p>“And ’tis said the Scots are not demonstrative,”
ejaculated Mr. Mackenzie, as another burst of applause
and cheers, followed by laughter, reached their
ears.</p>

<p>“You hear how demonstrative they can be when
occasion demands enthusiasm,” replied Lady Glencairn
stanchly, “when genius knocks at the door of
their hearts. See how Edinburgh has utterly lost
control of its conservative old self, and all over the
poetic genius of Robert Burns.”</p>

<p>“True, he has indeed stirred the hardest-hearted
Scot by his fascinating poetry,” mused Mr. Mackenzie
admiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“How I shall love him,” sighed Eppy dreamily.
“In sooth I do now,” and she simpered and dropped
her eyes like a love-sick school girl.</p>

<p>“And she has never met the man yet!” cried Sir
William in amazement. “The woman’s daft,” he
muttered, turning away.</p>

<p>“I do wish he would come,” sighed Eppy. “I
want to tell him how much I admire him and his
poetry. Oh, I have the dearest little speech, that
Sibella, my sister, composed, all prepared to say when
I am presented to him.” She rolled her eyes up ecstatically.</p>

<p>“I shall also recite one of his odes to him,” she
continued, in the tone of one who is about to confer
a great favor. “I know ’twill please him
greatly,” and she fanned herself languidly.</p>

<p>“What have you selected?” inquired Lady Glencairn,
laughing openly. The woman’s vanity amused
her.</p>

<p>“Such a sweet conceit,” simpered Eppy.</p>

<p>“Is it ‘Tam O’Shanter’s Tale’?” inquired Mr.
Mackenzie, interestedly.</p>

<p>“No, oh, no!” she replied, shaking her head.
“’Tis monstrous long to recite.”</p>

<p>“An ode to a calf,” said Sir William grimly,
“would be more appropriate.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps ’tis the tale of ‘The Twa Dogs,’” hazarded
Lady Glencairn. Eppy laughed gleefully and
shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell us the name, madam; we’re no children!”
roared Sir William, glaring at her like an angry
bull.</p>

<p>“You’re so gruff,” pouted Eppy reproachfully.
“Do you all give it up?” They nodded. “Well,
then, don’t be shocked,” and she shook her finger at
them coquettishly; then leaning forward she whispered
loudly, “’Tis entitled ‘To a Louse.’”</p>

<p>“Heaven, preserve us!” ejaculated Mr. Mackenzie,
laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“She’s touched here!” cried Sir William commiseratingly,
putting his finger to his head.</p>

<p>“Why did you choose that?” gasped Lady Glencairn,
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Because ’tis a beautiful conceit,” answered Eppy
soulfully. “I protest, I mean to recite it.”</p>

<p>“I vow ’tis a most singular selection.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” snapped Eppy spitefully.
“’Twas written round a fact.”</p>

<p>“Really, I hadn’t heard of that,” answered her
ladyship, coolly turning away.</p>

<p>“I wonder at that,” cooed Eppy innocently,
although a little malicious twinkle appeared in her
eyes. “You of all people should know everything
pertaining to Mr. Burns and his verses.” Lady
Glencairn stiffened suddenly, and cast a quick look
at the stern face of her uncle.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” inquired Sir
William aggressively, turning to Eppy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing!” she hastily replied,
frightened by what she had said.</p>

<p>“Everything concerning Mr. Burns, my husband’s
protégé, and my friend, my dear friend, I
may call him, does interest me mightily, Miss McKay.
Pray tell me the story connected with the
poem, if you care to!” and Lady Glencairn turned
her glittering eyes, which were narrowed dangerously,
upon the face of the crestfallen Eppy.</p>

<p>Sir William gave a snort of anger. “Ye couldn’t
stop her; she is dying to tell all she knows!” he said
crustily.</p>

<p>Eppy cleared her throat vigorously. “Well, it
was this way,” she began confidentially. “Mr.
Burns was sitting behind a lady in Kirk, one Sabbath,
who had on a new bonnet, of which she seemed
most proud. As he was admiring its beauty, his
keen eyes detected this horrid little animal crawling
over the gauze and lace.”</p>

<p>“How fascinating,” murmured Mr. Mackenzie in
mocking rapture.</p>

<p>“And it immediately inspired his pen to write the
verses which have made such a sensation in town,”
concluded Eppy, looking eagerly at her listeners for
some look or word of approval.</p>

<p>“What a—a creepy story,” said Lady Glencairn,
with a little shiver of repulsion.</p>

<p>She turned to her quickly. “’Tis said, my dear,
and I ask you not to repeat it, for I promised not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
tell, that the lady in question was Agnes McLehose,
the beautiful grass widow, who is such an ardent admirer
of Mr. Burns, you know.”</p>

<p>“Really!” murmured Lady Glencairn coldly.</p>

<p>“And the airs she put on!” cried Eppy, with
lofty indignation. “Why, do you know——”</p>

<p>But Lady Glencairn interrupted her sharply. “I
do not care to speak of Agnes McLehose,” she retorted
frigidly, “and I never indulge in scandal,
especially before my friends, so let us not disgust
them with any woman’s gossip.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” affirmed Eppy affably.
“I do not believe in it myself; it always comes back
to one.”</p>

<p>“Who can understand a woman?” grunted Sir
William aloud.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s most easy to understand men,” retorted
Eppy quickly.</p>

<p>With a sigh of impatience, Lady Glencairn took
Mr. Mackenzie’s arm and silently they reëntered the
drawing-room. They wended their way through the
groups of people standing about, for the largest and
most brilliant portion of the assemblage were standing,
the sofas, ottomans, and chairs being occupied
by the puffy old dowagers, who were entertaining
each other with choice bits of scandal; and, finally,
came to a standstill beside the grand piano. For a
moment they remained quiet, listening to the glorious
voice of Madame Urbani, who from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
drawing-room above was trilling forth an aria from
grand opera. From her position Lady Glencairn
commanded a good view of the large arch through
which the guests entered the drawing-rooms. Anxiously
she watched for the handsome face and
curly black hair of the poet above the crowd that
surrounded her. “Why does he not come? what can
be detaining him?” she asked herself for the hundredth
time. Perhaps he was with Lady Nancy
Gordon, she thought jealously, looking about the vast
room. She was sure she had not yet been announced.
It looked very suspicious that neither she, nor Robert,
had arrived. And her heart was consumed with
bitter jealousy, although her smiling face bore no
traces of the raging fire within. How she hated that
doll-faced beauty for being single and free! How
she would delight in trampling her in the dust, she
thought cruelly. Nearly a month had elapsed since
Robert left Edinburgh, since she had seen him. A
month filled with vain longing and unrest. And since
his return, she could scarcely restrain her intense
longing to see him. Day after day she would drive
slowly past his lodgings, hoping to catch a glimpse
of his glowing, dark face, which had such power to
thrill her to the very depths of her intense and
passionate nature. That longing had taken possession
of her to-night, when she had slipped out and
stolen away to his rooms, and she would have willingly
given her body and soul to him, for the asking;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
but her good angel had protected her from her
own indiscretion, and saved her unsuspecting victim
from a great remorse. The gurgling voice of Eppy
McKay broke in abruptly on her disturbing revery.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I wish Mr. Burns would come,” she
said plaintively.</p>

<p>“He is usually very punctual,” answered Lady
Glencairn, opening her large fan of ostrich plumes
and fanning herself indolently.</p>

<p>“Genius is never governed by any rules of punctuality
or propriety,” observed Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>“Then he is exempt,” replied her ladyship, smiling
brightly. “Ah! you truant. Where have you
been?” she demanded of her husband, who joined
them at that moment.</p>

<p>“Incidentally getting a breath of fresh air, my
dear,” replied Lord Glencairn, smiling lovingly into
his wife’s face. “But in reality, I was listening to
the ovation which Robert was receiving as he drove
through Princes Street.” Her eyes suddenly brightened.</p>

<p>“How I wish I could have heard his speech to the
masses,” she cried enthusiastically. “For I must
confess, James, that no man’s conversation ever
carried me off my feet so completely as that of Robert
Burns.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lady!” he retorted in mock alarm.
“Then it behooves me to keep my eye on you hereafter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>She joined in the laugh that followed, then remarked
audaciously, “But, I vow, a little flirtation
is really most exhilarating now and then.” She
flashed her brilliant eyes mockingly upon the horror-struck
countenance of Eppy McKay.</p>

<p>“How indiscreet!” exclaimed Eppy in amazement,
“and you are a married woman, too.”</p>

<p>“’Tis perfectly shocking, isn’t it?” mimicked her
ladyship insolently.</p>

<p>Eppy pursed her thin lips, while a little spot of
color dyed her parchment-like cheeks. “Well, I do
not approve of married women flirting,” she replied
primly, and as she caught the look of amusement
which passed between her ladyship and Mr. Mackenzie,
she added sourly, “Especially in public.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then you do approve of it in private,”
replied her ladyship sweetly, innocently opening her
eyes to their widest.</p>

<p>Eppy gave a gasp of horror. “Mercy, no!” she
cried indignantly, “I should say not.” And she
tossed her head in virtuous anger.</p>

<p>“Robert Burns!” announced the footman at this
juncture.</p>

<p>There was a sudden hush, a movement of excitement,
and the group around the door fell back, and
everybody made way for the most important guest
of the evening, who for the last hour had been the all-absorbing
topic of conversation. Lady Glencairn
started violently, as she heard the name announced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
For a brief instant she closed her eyes, feeling faint,
and trembling in an ecstasy of joy. He was here
at last! Her heart throbbed so violently it stifled
her.</p>

<p>“How noble he looks!” exclaimed Eppy in an
awestruck tone, as she watched the tall figure in a
polite but determined manner coolly elbowing a passage
among the heaving bare shoulders, fat arms,
the long trains, and bulging bustles and paniers
that seriously obstructed his way. “And to think
that man is but a lowly-bred peasant,” observed Mr.
Mackenzie, as he watched him bending low over the
hand of their hostess.</p>

<p>“A man’s a man, for all that!” murmured her
ladyship, worshipful pride in her voice and in her
dazzling eyes, as she watched him approach, bowing
right and left. She drew herself up with the conscious
air of a beauty who knows she is nearly perfect,
and with a smile she extended her jeweled hand.
“I’m so glad to see you here to-night,” she says
sweetly, although a glance like fire seen through
smoke leaps from beneath her silky eyelashes, but
Robert saw it not; he was bending low over her fair
hand. “Welcome back to Edinburgh!” she continued,
pressing his hand warmly.</p>

<p>A bright smile lighted up his dark visage.
“Thank ye,” he returned simply. Then he turned
to Lord Glencairn with outstretched hand. “My
lord!” he said warmly, “how glad, how delighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
I am to again press the hand of my patron, my
friend.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mutual, my lad!” he replied. A
kindly smile lighted up his noble face, as he perceived
the ruddy glow of health in the full cheeks,
the flashing eyes of the young poet. “Ah, you return
to us looking bonnier than ever,” he continued.
“Your triumphant tour through the north with
its Highland chieftains and lords at your feet, has
not turned your head after all.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed good-naturedly. “Not a bit of
it,” he replied frankly.</p>

<p>“Let me present Mr. Henry Mackenzie,” introduced
Lady Glencairn at this juncture.</p>

<p>Robert advanced eagerly to meet him, his hand
extended, his eyes flashing with delight. “The
author of the ‘Man of Feeling,’ the first book I
loved and admired years ago!” he exclaimed in direct
frankness. “It is an unexpected pleasure, sir.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mutual,” replied Mr. Mackenzie,
flushing at the compliment. “We witnessed
your triumphant progress up Princes Street, and
were delighted at the ovation you received.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed happily. “Was it not wonderful?”
he answered in his sonorous voice, which had
such a thrilling richness in it. “I could scarcely
realize it was the once poor, humble Robbie Burns
they were cheering. I am indeed happy; my
popularity has not begun to wane yet.” He regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the great publisher with kindling eyes.
“That I am so favorably known, is due to your
kindly articles in your inestimable paper, <i>The
Lounger</i>, and your unbiased criticism of my poems,
which brought me before the public, and I thank you
most heartily for that generous criticism which was
so judicious withal.” A little murmur of approval
from his listeners greeted his last words.</p>

<p>“’Twas a pleasure, believe me, Mr. Burns,” he
answered quietly, “to lend a helping hand to assist
a struggling genius.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” said Robert, simply.</p>

<p>“I believe you have never met our esteemed
contemporary, Mr. Sterne, author of ‘Tristam
Shandy,’” observed Mr. Mackenzie, and he quickly
made the introduction.</p>

<p>Robert turned quickly to the grave and dignified
scholar. “Little did I ever dream,” he said fervently,
“that I would one day meet and converse with
my two favorite authors.”</p>

<p>A smile of gratified vanity overspread the rugged
features of the scholar. “I am proud indeed,” he
observed pompously, “if my book has found favor in
your eyes, Mr. Burns.” And soon they had become
engaged in an animated conversation, much to the
chagrin of one of his admirers, who had been waiting
patiently to be introduced. She had been mentally
rehearsing her little speech for some time, and was
now waiting for the opportunity to deliver it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“No one would ever take him for a farmer,” she
thought in open-mouthed, worshipful adoration.</p>

<p>“He looks quite like a gentleman,” said a haughty
voice near her, in a tone of great surprise.</p>

<p>“Huh! he makes love to every woman he meets!”
replied Sir William spitefully.</p>

<p>With a thrill of rapture at the thought, Eppy
attracted the attention of Lady Glencairn, and
whispered in that lady’s impatient ear, “Introduce
me, please; I see Mr. Burns is regarding me very
closely.”</p>

<p>Presently a lull occurred in the discussion, and
Lady Glencairn smilingly introduced the garrulous
old lady to the poet, as a “warm admirer of his
poems.” “And of you, too,” eagerly interrupted
Eppy, clasping his hand in both of her own. “Oh!
I have longed for this moment, that I might clasp
the hand of Scotia’s Bard, and tell him how I love
him,”—she broke off with a smothered giggle. “I
mean his poems; oh, they are too heavenly for utterance,”
and she rolled her little gray eyes till only the
whites showed. “Sibella—she’s my sister, and a
dear creature if I do say so—and I have had many
a lovely cry over them,” she rattled on hardly pausing
for breath. “Ah, they have made us so happy.
You must come and see her, won’t you, she’s a writer
also, and you can have a sweet talk over your art.
We belong to a literary family, you know. Rob
Don, the Gaelic poet, belonged to our clan. We take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
after him.” She smiled affectedly and batted her
little eyes in what she fondly believed a very fetching
manner.</p>

<p>Robert had vainly tried to edge in a word, and
now stood listening to the silly prattle, a smile of
amusement playing round his mobile mouth.</p>

<p>“A long way after,” observed Sir William dryly.
Then he threw up his hands in dismay, for Eppy had
started off again.</p>

<p>“Here I am rattling off a lot of nonsense,” she
gurgled, “but I do enjoy your talking so much, Mr.
Burns. I vow I could listen to it all day. I shall
always remember this happy occasion of our meeting.”
She stopped, out of breath, panting but
happy.</p>

<p>Robert regarded her quizzically for a moment
while an audible titter was heard throughout the
rooms. “You quite overwhelm me, Miss McKay,”
he drawled at last. “But I have nevertheless enjoyed
conversing with you. Really, madam, I felt
quite eloquent and did myself full justice,” and he
bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, you flatterer!” tittered Eppy, slapping his
arm coquettishly with her fan. “But I am not
madam yet.” She ventured a quick look at Sir
William.</p>

<p>“Robert, I have been requested to ask you to
recite one of your favorite poems; will you honor
us?” asked Lord Glencairn, coming forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>At once there was a chorus of inanely polite voices.
“Oh, do recite, Mr. Burns!” “Please give us ‘Tam
O’Shanter’s Ride,’” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Robert slowly looked around him at the sea of
faces, and suddenly a feeling of resentment filled his
heart. Must he parade himself before these empty-headed
noodles, who regarded him in the light of a
curiosity, a plaything, to amuse them by his antics?
Why didn’t they ask Mr. Mackenzie or Mr. Sterne or
Dr. Blacklock, Mr. Ramsay, or any one of the others
to read from their books?</p>

<p>“I must ask ye to excuse me to-night,” he replied
coldly. “I have been speaking in the open air and
my voice is tired.”</p>

<p>“Then I will recite in your stead,” cried Eppy,
determined to make an impression on the romantic
young farmer.</p>

<p>They crowded around her, laughing and joking,
for poor Eppy was the innocent, unsuspecting butt
of society.</p>

<p>“What is your selection?” someone asked
seriously.</p>

<p>“’Tis about the cunning little animal Mr. Burns
saw on the lady’s bonnet,” replied Eppy. “The
lady’s name was—er——” She paused and looked
inquiringly into Robert’s grimly amused face.</p>

<p>“Ye would be very much surprised, perhaps
shocked and grieved, Miss McKay,” he answered,
“were I to mention the lady’s name here, so I’ll spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
your feelings. Please recite the poem.” Eppy
made a deep courtesy, blissfully unconscious that the
lady in question was none else than herself. And
after arranging her dress to her satisfaction, cleared
her throat affectedly and made several ineffectual attempts
to begin the recitation. Gradually a look of
comical despair puckered up her face, and turning to
Robert with an embarrassed giggle, she exclaimed
poutingly, “I cannot recall a single line. How provoking,
and I protest. I knew every line by rote this
morning. Please start me on the first verse, Mr.
Burns.”</p>

<p>The spectacle of this silly old woman making a
fool of herself before that heartless crowd both annoyed
and embarrassed Robert. “The last verse is
my favorite,” he replied, frowning angrily at the
amused titters which reached his ears from all sides,
and quickly he read the verse through:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh wad some power the giftie gie us</div>
<div class="verse">To see ourselves as others see us.</div>
<div class="verse">It wad fra many a blunder free us, and foolish notion</div>
<div class="verse">What airs in dress and gait wad leave us, and e’en devotion.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And none knew whether the shaft was pointed at
them or at the object of their mirth, who stood before
him with clasped hands and a smile meant to be
winning on her weak face, listening with all her
senses.</p>

<p>“How true that is,” murmured Lady Glencairn.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” sighed Eppy soulfully. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
fools some people make of themselves, and they never
know it, which is the funny part of it.” She darted
a quick glance at Lady Glencairn, who returned the
look calmly and evenly, although she was saying to
herself, “Is she the fool she appears, or is she giving
me a dig, I wonder?”</p>

<p>She turned to Robert. “Mr. Burns, will you find
me a chair, please; I am rather fatigued, standing
so long.”</p>

<p>He offered her his arm. “It will be rather a
difficult matter,” he observed, looking about him
vainly. “Still, I can try.” And he moved through
the swaying crowd and out upon the balcony, with
her little gloved hand resting lightly on his coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>“I saw you this morning, Mr. Burns, on Calton
Hill,” she observed lightly, “but at a distance.
Upon driving nearer I lost sight of you; you must
have vanished into the air.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Robert, sitting beside her
on the low balustrade. “I found a beautiful solitude
amongst a luxuriant growth of willows, which
no doubt you overlooked.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” she returned. “Now I remember.
A sad scene occurred there a few years ago; a lady
from Loch Carron drowned herself in the little pond
they hang over, because the man she loved despised
her.” Her voice was soft and low. She drooped
her eyes and sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor unhappy woman,” sighed Robert sympathetically.</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly, her face flushing, her
eyes earnestly searching his face. “Then you would
have pitied her?” she asked almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>“He cannot be a man who would not pity a woman
under such circumstances,” he replied simply and
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“She loved him devotedly, recklessly,” she continued,
her voice trembling with suppressed emotion;
“but she had no moral right to do so,” she continued.
“She was a wife, a miserable, unhappy
wife; she deserved much pity, but he was pitiless
and uncharitable. He despised her weakness, and so—she
drowned herself.” Her voice sank into a
strained, unnatural whisper.</p>

<p>“Poor unhappy woman!” he repeated compassionately.
“She was over-hasty, I fear.”</p>

<p>“You would not have consigned her to such a
fate, would you?” she faltered, laying her soft
feverish hand on his.</p>

<p>He started violently and was silent for a time.
Then, slowly, sorrowfully he turned and looked into
her tell-tale face; for a moment she gazed at him,
her eyes glittering with an unholy light, her bosom
heaving tumultuously. Then she slowly drooped her
head.</p>

<p>“’Twould be a heavy load to have on one’s conscience,”
he replied constrainedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose from his seat and stood looking thoughtfully
across to where Edinburgh castle loomed up on
the hill, so cold and gloomy, outlined against the
blue sky.</p>

<p>She glided swiftly to his side. “Robert, let
me——” she began passionately, when the cold
voice of Sir William Creech rooted her to the spot
in terror. Out of the shadow walked her uncle, and
ignoring her presence he addressed himself to Robert.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Burns!” he said angrily, “perhaps
ye’ll condescend to notice me now, your publisher,
Sir William Creech.”</p>

<p>“I hope ye’re well,” returned Robert indifferently.</p>

<p>Sir William quivered with rage. “Ye’ve been in
town a week, and yet ye have not called to notify me
of your arrival,” he sputtered.</p>

<p>“I quite forgot, Sir William,” answered Rob repentently;
“you see I’m not a good business man.
However, to-morrow I will call and we will arrange
our much neglected business matters.”</p>

<p>“And there is much to arrange. Why did ye
refuse to write for my weekly? I offered to pay ye
well for it,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Pay!” flashed Rob indignantly. “Do you think
to buy the fruit of my brain like so much merchandise,
at so much a line for a penny newspaper? I
am not a penny journalist, I am a poet. Whenever
I embark on any undertaking it is with honest enthusiasm,
and to talk of money, wage, or fee would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
be a downright prostitution of the soul,” and his
eyes flashed dangerously.</p>

<p>“You do not despise money, Robert Burns?” retorted
Sir William sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Most certainly not!” replied Robert quickly.
“’Tis a most necessary commodity, but extremely
elusive, and to show you that money has no terrors
for me, I shall expect a settlement to-morrow in full.
Some £300 are due me from the sale of the last
edition of my songs.” He returned Sir William’s
wrathful gaze, his eyes full of righteous anger and
strong determination.</p>

<p>“Just one word more, Mr. Burns!” he began
belligerently, but Robert raised his hand with a
stately gesture.</p>

<p>“I’m in a sorry mood for business, Sir William
Creech,” he warned him, a steely glitter in his eye.</p>

<p>“Well, ye will hear what I’ve to say,” insisted Sir
William doggedly. “Ye are under contract to me,
sir; but instead of living up to the terms of that
agreement, ye are scattering broadcast to every person
that pleases your fancy, a song or an ode or a
poem, which diminishes the worth and consequent
sale of your collection.”</p>

<p>“Lud, uncle,” interposed Lady Glencairn quickly,
“I’ll warrant it makes not the slightest difference.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not fair to me,” sputtered Sir William,
“and I warn ye, Mr. Burns, ye must not do it again.
I strictly forbid it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Uncle!” gasped Lady Glencairn in amazement.</p>

<p>“Ye forbid?” repeated Robert in immeasurable
scorn. “Ye nor any man living can dictate to Robert
Burns. I shall write when an’ for whom I please.
I will not barter an’ sell my soul like so much merchandise.
You published my collection of songs an’
have made money out o’ the transaction, which is
mair than I have done. I am sick of it all; I am
done with your roguery, your deceit, now an’ forever.”
And he waved his hand in angry dismissal.</p>

<p>“But our contract,” gasped Sir William, taken
aback.</p>

<p>“’Tis ended now, canceled by your ain insult, an’
I shall take means to collect my just dues.”</p>

<p>“Are you not hasty?” asked Lady Glencairn
concernedly.</p>

<p>“I told ye to call to-morrow,” snarled Sir William,
“and I’ll pay ye, then ye can gang your own gait.
I have sought to give you advice, but ye were too
haughty and independent, and ye wouldn’t listen,
but ye will yet see and realize the bitter truth of
my words, so go on in your career of folly and its
inevitable ruin, for ye’ll soon be at the end of your
tether, and may the devil claim ye for his own.”
He stalked angrily away, muttering to himself, “Ye
upstart, ye low-born peasant, I’ll humble ye yet!”</p>

<p>Robert turned to Lady Glencairn with a smile of
apology on his lips. “I ask your pardon, Lady
Glencairn,” he said humbly, “for being the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
this unseemly scene in your presence, but my anger
was aroused, an’ I simply couldna’ help speaking my
thoughts—I am always doing the wrong thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” she responded laughingly. “Let
us forget it and join the others.” She took his arm
and they slowly entered the ballroom, where they
were speedily joined by Lord Glencairn and a party
of friends, who immediately surrounded them.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Lord Glencairn, “do you know
that you have left us an unconscionable time? Is
there some witchery about yon balcony that I know
not of?” and he smiled affectionately upon his wife,
whose eyes were shining with happiness.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, James, but I’m sure our absence
was not noted in such a distinguished assemblage.”
She glanced carelessly about the room at the groups
of sedate-looking people gravely conversing with each
other while they strolled slowly, aimlessly about with
much dignity and ceremony, and an almost imperceptible
sneer curled her full lips. “Oh, the stiff
formality of some of these Calvinistic old fossils!”
she remarked contemptuously to Robert.</p>

<p>“From all such people, good Lord deliver us,”
he replied in a low chant.</p>

<p>“Amen!” cried Eppy, looking archly at Sir
William. “Give me youth and gayety always.”
Sir William looked his unspoken scorn.</p>

<p>“You and I may well sigh for youth, Miss McKay,”
quavered the venerable Dr. Blacklock. “Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
moons have passed since he eluded our clutch and
fled, never to return,” and he sighed dismally.</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, Doctor,” bridled Eppy. “I
shall never let go my hold on youth,” and she tossed
her head indignantly.</p>

<p>“Speaking of fossils,” said Lady Glencairn pointedly,
turning to Eppy, “I wonder what can have
happened to Mrs. Dunlop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is always late for effect,” she replied
spitefully.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dunlop is a very dear friend of mine,”
observed Robert quietly, but his eyes flashed with
indignation.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for my rudeness,” murmured
Lady Glencairn sweetly.</p>

<p>“I understand Mrs. Dunlop is chaperoning a new
beauty,” said Lord Glencairn inquiringly to his
wife.</p>

<p>She gave him a side glance that was far from
pleasant. New beauty, indeed! There was only one
recognized beauty in Edinburgh and she would not
yield the palm to anyone. “I really do not know to
whom you allude, James,” she said coldly.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Athol, who was standing near,
smiled significantly. “Mrs. Dunlop asked permission
to bring a young friend, who was visiting her
from the Highlands,” she remarked pleasantly. “I
do not know her in the least, and they may not come
at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Dunlop and Miss Campbell!” announced
the footman loudly. With a smile on his handsome
face and a hurried word of apology, Robert rapidly
walked to meet the approaching couple, who were
the cynosure of all eyes. Mrs. Dunlop was recognized
by all as a woman of much importance in Edinburgh
society. She knew everybody and everybody
knew her, for she was the lineal descendant of the immortal
Wallace, a fact of which she was justly proud.
She was a motherly looking woman, with a charming
smile and a pleasant, taking manner.</p>

<p>But the murmur of admiration throughout the
room was not for her; it was for the slim little girl in
white with the blue eyes and fair hair, which glittered
like gold beneath the brilliant light of the chandeliers.
“Who can she be?” they whispered to each
other in wonder. “Evidently not a person of importance,
else she would be dressed in the fashion of
the day and have her hair powdered.”</p>

<p>“At last, Mary, ye’re here!” cried Robert delightedly,
placing her hand within his arm. She
clung to it with a nervous clutch.</p>

<p>“The child is frightened to death,” whispered
Mrs. Dunlop, smiling indulgently.</p>

<p class="caption">“‘Mrs. Dunlop and Miss Campbell,’ announced the footman loudly.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Glencairn turned very pale, as she recognized
the girl she had met in Robert’s room. She trembled
and could scarcely regain her usual composure
as Robert with a proud tenderness lighting up the
depths of his black eyes, led the vision of youth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
perfect beauty up to the hostess, to whom he introduced
Mary. Then he turned to Lady Glencairn.
“Lady Glencairn, allow me to introduce to you Miss
Campbell. You remember Highland Mary, do you
not?”</p>

<p>She gave a slight start and her muscles tightened.
The dairymaid sweetheart here in Edinburgh? she
thought in amazement. What could it mean?</p>

<p>“Quite well,” she answered, extending her cold
jeweled hand. “I little dreamed I should ever meet
you here like this, but the unexpected always
happens.”</p>

<p>“Dinna’ ye mind, my lady,” replied Mary simply,
“ye said ye would be glad to see me whenever I came
to town.” She raised those marvelous, innocent eyes
of hers and smiled. Why did Lady Glencairn
shrink from that frank and childlike openness of
regard? Why did she for one brief moment feel
herself to be vile and beneath contempt? She
turned to where Mrs. Dunlop was conversing animatedly
with their hostess, a flush akin to shame mantling
her haughty face.</p>

<p>“My dear Duchess,” she was saying apologetically,
“pray pardon our late arrival, but I assure you
’tis not made for effect; our carriage broke down on
the way.”</p>

<p>Eppy started in amazement; had she overheard her
spiteful remark?</p>

<p>The Duchess graciously inclined her stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
head. “So glad you got here at all, Mrs. Dunlop,”
she said.</p>

<p>Robert turned laughingly to the group of eager
people importuning him for an introduction to the
beautiful débutante. “Time forbids my introducing
ye individually to Miss Campbell,” he said good-naturedly,
“therefore let me present ye collectively
to Highland Mary, my future wife, whom ye have
all read of an’ loved in my poems.” A ripple of
applause greeted the news, and congratulations
poured in upon them, both hearty and sincere.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn staggered slightly, her face paling,
but she quickly recovered and stood haughtily
erect, fanning herself a little more rapidly, her full
red lips tightened to a thin malicious line.</p>

<p>Eppy rushed up to Mary effusively. “May I
kiss you, dear?” she asked gushingly, “you are so
sweet and pretty, just like I was a few years ago,”
and she kissed the blushing girl with a resounding
smack. “You’ll be married in Edinburgh, I presume?”
she continued volubly. “I must attend the
wedding.”</p>

<p>“The marriage will be most private, madam,”
observed Robert coldly.</p>

<p>“Do you stay long in Edinburgh, Miss Campbell?”
asked Lady Glencairn abruptly, forcing a
smile to her lips.</p>

<p>“No, not long, your ladyship,” replied Mary
timidly. The cold metallic tones of the haughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
lady frightened her strangely. “I—I ne’er thought
I’d e’er come to Edinburgh,” she said, “but——”
She hesitated and looked shyly at Robert, and then
looked modestly down at the bit of cobweb lace which
she held in her hand and which did duty as a ’kerchief.</p>

<p>“But I found the barrier between us was down,
that I was free as ever to wed the sweetheart of my
boyhood days,” he explained with simple dignity.</p>

<p>“Aye, but you make a bonnie couple,” exclaimed
Mrs. Dunlop admiringly. “Well, I don’t blame
anyone for falling in love with you, Robert,” she
declared frankly. “You’re a great man,” and she
nodded her head vigorously. “And a handsome one,
too.”</p>

<p>Robert blushed and shook his finger in warning at
his old friend, although a tender smile played around
his eyes and mouth. “Mrs. Dunlop, men are said to
flatter women because they are weak,” he said, “but if
it is so, poets must be weaker still, for the artful compliments
I have received from your sex have absolutely
turned my head, an’ really I begin to look on
myself as a person of no small importance,” and he
roguishly winked his eye at his old friend.</p>

<p>“I never knew a man yet who was averse to flattery,”
retorted the old lady good-naturedly.</p>

<p>In the brief lull that followed the general laugh,
the voice of Lord Glencairn could be heard in conversation
with Mary, who was earnestly gazing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
into his face, all traces of timidity gone, for she felt
singularly at her ease in the presence of the kindly
old nobleman. “And so you mean to take Robert
away from us for good, eh?” he was saying in his
earnest, serious manner.</p>

<p>“Ye ken he is fair anxious to get back to Mossgiel
now,” replied Mary, blushing deeply.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn snapped her fan together convulsively.
“You mean to leave Edinburgh for good?”
she asked in faint, incredulous accents, turning to
Robert.</p>

<p>The people crowded around and a storm of protest
arose. “What madness!” “Leave Edinburgh
for the country!” “They couldn’t hear of such a
thing.” “He owed a duty to them as Scotland’s
Bard!” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Robert turned to them and spoke lightly, although
with an undercurrent of seriousness. “I ken I am
but wasting my time, my energies, my talents here,
amid the sensual delight which your city affords,”
he said. “I am not formed for it. I am but a
rustic at heart and in manners, and the country is
my only vantageground.”</p>

<p>Mary stole softly to his side and snuggled her
hand in his. “Isn’t it sweet to be in love?” cried
Eppy cooingly, to Sir William, in a sibilant aside.
“Think what we are missing.”</p>

<p>“We’re too old for such nonsense,” replied Sir
William gruffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” flashed Eppy. “Huh, a woman’s
never too old to love,” with an indignant toss of her
head.</p>

<p>“No, nor to make a fool of herself,” retorted Sir
William, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>“But we cannot give you up just yet,” declared
Lord Glencairn emphatically, placing his hand affectionately
on Robert’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I am sure, Mr. Burns,” said Mr. Mackenzie
gravely, “that your friends and admirers would not
advise such a move for you, especially as you are
now riding high on the top wave of success.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to gain by staying here, Mr.
Mackenzie,” replied Robert, turning to him and
speaking slowly and thoughtfully, “for, as you observe,
I am now firmly established as a poet. I fear
I am not proof against the subtle temptations which
constantly beset my path and which push aside all
thoughts of poesy; so as discretion is the better part
of valor,” he continued, looking lovingly at the girl
clinging so confidingly to his arm, “I shall flee from
it all to my farm, my plow, and there amid those
innocent, wholesome surroundings pass my remaining
days in peace wi’ my wife by my side.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop sighed dismally and shook her white
curls in decided disapproval. “Laddie, you will be
taking a false step,” she declared emphatically;
“your place is here before the public.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is!” gurgled Eppy soulfully. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
protest Edinburgh cannot spare its poet yet. Your
old farm can wait for you yet a while.”</p>

<p>Mary looked at his thoughtful face with anxious
eyes. She prayed fervently that nothing would dissuade
him from his purpose. For it had been at
her earnest solicitation that he finally decided to
give up the enervating pleasures of the Capital, and
to retire to the country where he would be free from
the contaminating influences which now surrounded
him.</p>

<p>He smiled reassuringly into her perturbed little
face. No power on earth could tempt him to break
the promise he had so willingly made her on that
first day of her arrival in the gay metropolis, he
thought fondly. He turned to his questioners, who
were eagerly awaiting his answer, his face shining
with fixed determination.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said quietly, “I am only a
farmer born, a son of the soil. My one ambition
now is to have my own roof-tree near the Doon,
where amidst the beauties of harmonious nature the
Goddess Muse will commune with me as of old, for
’twas there the greatest inspiration of my soul came
to me, and I know if all else fails me an independent
livelihood awaits me at the plowtail.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, the plowtail, indeed!” sniffed Mrs.
Dunlop indignantly.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn, who had been feverishly toying
with her fan, turned suddenly to Mary, a sneering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
smile on her crimson lips, “And have you no higher
ambition for your future husband, Miss Campbell?”
she demanded, her voice strangely harsh and metallic.
“Are you content to have him bury his talents
in the country?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes!” answered Mary shyly, a happy
smile dimpling her sweet face. Then she added
naïvely, “Ye ken, I’ll hae him all to myself then.”
Robert laughed merrily at this naïve confession.</p>

<p>“Young man,” observed Mr. Sterne pompously,
“take my word for it, you’ll repent it if you leave
Edinburgh now.”</p>

<p>“Robbie, what will everybody think?” cried Mrs.
Dunlop tearfully. “You are daft to run away while
the world is literally at your feet.”</p>

<p>“For how long?” he asked laconically.</p>

<p>“Until you tire of its homage, my lad,” replied
Lord Glencairn stanchly.</p>

<p>Robert shook his head with a doubting smile.
“’Twill not be I who will tire first, my lord,” he
returned quietly. “I know myself and the world so
well. You see the novelty of a poet in my obscure
situation, my imperfection of awkward rusticity has
raised a partial tide of public notice which has borne
me to a height where I am absolutely certain my
abilities are inadequate to support me.” He looked
around a trifle defiantly at the rows of serious
faces, a little feeling of resentment welling up in his
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are over-modest, my dear Burns,” observed
Mr. Mackenzie with kindling eye.</p>

<p>Robert shook his head with somber dignity. “Too
surely do I see the time when the same tide will leave
me and recede as far below the mark of truth.” He
turned and faced the people suddenly, his hands outstretched,
his eyes filled with melancholy enthusiasm.
Raising his voice he proceeded prophetically, “My
friends, you will all bear me witness, that when the
bubble of fame was at its height I stood unintoxicated,
with the inebriating cup in my hand, looking
forward to the hastening time when the blow of
calumny should dash it to the ground with all the
eagerness of revengeful triumph.”</p>

<p>“That time will never come, Robert,” cried Mary
softly, “for we will leave this life behind us in a
very short while noo.”</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn slapped him on the back with
playful earnestness. “Come, come, my lad!” he
cried gayly, “this will never do; you are in the
dumps; throw it off, lad, and be merry. Do not
heed the idle gossip of your unsuccessful rivals and
the scandal mongers. Rest assured your popularity
and fame will never die whether you remain here
or retire to the country.”</p>

<p>“Would I could think so,” sighed Robert gloomily.</p>

<p>Eppy suddenly gave a nervous little giggle. “I
vow I feel like crying,” she observed hysterically,
“I wish everybody wouldn’t look so mournful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie turned quickly to his hostess.
“My dear Duchess,” he said courteously, “you
were going to show us your new painting in
which Mr. Burns is the central figure of the
group.”</p>

<p>At once the silent group became animated. “Oh,
yes, do!” cried Eppy, with a yearning look at
Robert. “I wonder if I could pick you from among
the others?” she coyly observed.</p>

<p>“I trust, madam, that my phiz will be recognizable,”
he replied dryly.</p>

<p>The Duchess turned to her husband. “Take Miss
Campbell and lead the way to the gallery,” she said
quickly.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Burns to take me?” inquired Eppy of
her hostess, but she had followed her husband, leaning
on the arm of Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn smiled sweetly, “So sorry, Miss
McKay, but Sir William has asked for that pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I?” gasped Sir William, with a comical look of
dismay.</p>

<p>She looked at him maliciously. “Yes, did you
not?” she raised her eyebrows inquiringly, an innocent
smile hovering about her mouth.</p>

<p>For a moment he sputtered, then with a grim
smile he snarled sarcastically, “’Twill afford me
great pleasure.”</p>

<p>With a wildly beating heart Lady Glencairn took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Robert’s arm and started for the stairs, followed
by the others.</p>

<p>Eppy sniffed suspiciously. “Oh, I understand
now,” she observed spitefully with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>“I thought you would, dear,” flashed her ladyship
mockingly, over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, madam?” demanded Sir William
testily, offering his arm.</p>

<p>With an indignant clack of her tongue, Eppy
haughtily brushed past him and swiftly mounted the
stairs, leaving the disgruntled Sir William to follow
at his leisure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p>Among those that crowded around the carriage of
Robert Burns earlier in the evening, listening to
his inspiring oration, stood a girl of twenty or
thereabouts, whose pale, haggard face and tearful
eyes attracted some passing attention from those
near her. She was dressed in an ankle length skirt
of gray, over which a red shawl had been tastefully
draped. A black velvet bodice confined the loose
white gimpe at the waist, while from her left shoulder
a brilliant plaid hung gracefully to the bottom
of her dress. Around her neck row upon row of
different colored beads hung loosely to her waist.
Upon the blue-black hair which fell around her
face in waving masses, a wreath of white and pink
heather was twined becomingly. Her unusual attire
attracted much attention.</p>

<p>“She must be a gypsy,” they told each other
wonderingly. Finally, after many conjectures, someone
in the crowd volunteered the information that
she was a street singer who had been seen singing
through the streets of the town for a day or so.
Their curiosity appeased, they turned to their idol
once more. Every now and then a convulsive sob
shook the young girl’s slender, graceful figure. Like
one who hungered for food and drink she watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
speaker, her heart in her eyes, her hands clasped
tightly upon her breast. When the eager throng unhitched
the horses from the open carriage she had
breathlessly watched every movement, and when they,
with wild bursts of applause and good-natured
laughter, sped away up Princes Street, pulling the
carriage behind them, she had swiftly followed, the
center of a noisy gang of street urchins and idle
brawlers.</p>

<p>With a mighty cheer, which brought the watchmen
running to the spot pell-mell, they finally
stopped at Athol Castle and quickly lined themselves
on each side of the striped awning avenue, from the
curbing to the door, to watch the great man pass
within.</p>

<p>The gypsy frantically elbowed her way through
the pompous coachmen and good-natured cabbies
who had pressed forward to witness the new arrival,
and reached the inner edge of the crowd. At that
moment Robert stepped from his carriage and walked
quickly up the avenue. With a little cry of joy she
stretched out her hands to arrest his attention, but
he passed inside without having once caught a
glimpse of this strange follower.</p>

<p>A derisive laugh went up from those who had
curiously watched the peculiar actions of the gypsy.
At the sound she dropped her arms hurriedly, the
blood rushing to her pale cheeks. With one quick,
startled glance at the mocking faces beside her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
turned quickly and threaded her way through the
line of splendid equipages, with their prancing horses,
till she reached a secluded part of the street, where
she stopped and looked back at the brilliantly lighted
castle, tears of bitter disappointment and despair
slowly trickling down her wan cheeks. As she stood
there in the bright moonlight, a prey to her bitter
thoughts, a handsome equipage, drawn by a prancing
pair of steeds, attracted her listless attention. As
it slowly drove past the wretched girl a sweet young
face crowned with golden hair appeared in the open
window, followed by a white arm. Her little hand
was noticeably bare of jewels. With a sweet word of
pity the girl tossed a silver piece at the feet of
her unfortunate sister. The gypsy indifferently
watched the carriage out of sight. Then, after a
moment’s hesitation, she stooped and picked up the
coin, and without looking at it put it carelessly in
her pocket, a flush of shame and mortification mantling
her dark cheek. For a while she stood in moody
silence, listening to the strains of music which came
faintly to her from the castle. Suddenly she lifted
her face to the heavens, her arms upraised, her lips
moving in some prayer or incantation. For a moment
she stood thus, then slowly her arms dropped to
her side. There was a new calm look of determination
in her face as she quickly traced her steps back to
where the crowds still lingered about the closed doors
of Athol Castle. She stood on the outskirts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the crowd unseen in the shadow, her restless eyes
searching here and there, peering into the open windows,
up and down the high stone wall which bordered
the huge garden, then back again, finally
resting upon the closed portals with a look of keen
disappointment shining in their depths. What she
sought was evidently not there. She stamped her
foot in impotent despair, a muttered imprecation
on her lips; she would search again. Gradually she
made her way back unnoticed by the crowd, who
were intent on listening to the music which floated
out bewitchingly on the still air, till she reached
the wall where it joined the corner of the castle.
Motionless she stood under its shadow, her heart
beating loudly as some idler drew near her place of
concealment. Suddenly a form loomed up before
her. With a startled cry she pressed close against
the ivied wall in sudden terror.</p>

<p>“She come this way,” a voice cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Aye, Sandy, she’s hidin’ among the ivy,” said
another.</p>

<p>She heard them beating noisily about the thick
vines which hung in wild profusion over the walls,
her heart in her mouth. Frantically she tore the
vines apart until she reached the bare wall behind.
Then with breathless eagerness she pulled them together
again, effectually concealing her presence
from her pursuers. She pressed closer and closer
against the cold stones, shivering apprehensively
as they approached her hiding place. Suddenly she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
felt her support give way with a dull, creaking noise,
and before she could recover her equilibrium, she
found herself in a heap on the ground. She looked
up in time to see the door through which she had
fallen swing quickly into place and realized that
unwittingly she had found an old and evidently
unused entrance through the wall. Quickly rising
to her feet she looked about her, then she gave a
little cry of joy as she caught sight of the splashing
fountains in the moonlight, for she knew she was
inside the gardens belonging to the Duke of Athol.
Eagerly she gazed about her at the leafy shrubberies,
the massive oaks and beeches, the rose garden
with its wealth of scented flowers. And for a brief
moment she gave herself up to the painful reveries
the familiar sights recalled to memory, while the tears
of self-pity and heart-longing welled up in her
gloomy eyes and flowed unrestrainedly down her
cheeks. Presently, with a mirthless laugh of impatience,
she dashed the tears angrily away and walked
quickly up the grassy terrace toward the brilliantly
lighted castle. Through the large window which
looked over the low balcony she watched the incessant
stream of people coming and going, while others
walked aimlessly about the rooms or chatted in
groups. For some time she crouched beside the
low silver spruce, her eyes fixed upon the moving
scenes within. Then with a start she recognized the
golden-haired young lady who had given her the
silver piece, surrounded by a group of cavaliers. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
saw, too, with a pang of jealousy, the tenderness
with which the poet greeted her and led her up to
the haughty lady in purple. For some time she
watched them in melancholy silence, a prey to conflicting
emotions. By and by a group of ladies
drifted out on the balcony. They were discussing
the golden-haired girl, who had been introduced into
their midst that evening, and the announcement of
her marriage to the poet, Robert Burns. The gypsy,
as she heard those words, uttered a smothered cry
of amazement and horror, then sank half fainting
on the grassy lawn, moaning like one stricken unto
death. How long she lay there with senses dulled
by pain she never knew. Presently, bitter recollection
returned and with it an agony of fear that
blanched her lips and made her limbs to quake, while
grief and despair, like two grim sentinels, stood
eager watch beside her. Slowly she staggered to
her feet and turned her weary eyes once more upon
the balcony. There was no one there. Listlessly
she watched the gay figures darting past the windows.
Suddenly her muscles tightened like a hound’s
on the scent. The golden-haired girl suddenly glided
out on the balcony, a glorious vision of loveliness.
Pensively she leaned over the railing watching the
swans, which looked ghostly in the moonlight, swimming
majestically round and round the small pond
of water into which the spraying fountain was
playing.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p>Mary soon grew weary of looking at the many paintings
which lined the walls of the galleries; she wished
they would go back to the pretty rooms downstairs,
where the music was playing and the young folks were
dancing. She had enjoyed that. She tried to force a
smile of interest to her lips as the old Duke described
the subjects on the canvases before them. He soon
perceived her weariness, however, and calling to Mrs.
Dunlop, who was being bored beyond measure, as
she told her friends wearily, he requested her to
show Miss Campbell the gardens by moonlight, to
which she gladly assented. Quickly they descended
the broad staircase, and slowly wended their way
across the large drawing-room. Mrs. Dunlop took
her young charge to the large window and waved
her fat hand toward the magnificent view which lay
stretched before them. “Isn’t it grand, Mary?” she
observed lightly. It was an old story to her. Spying
an old friend across the room, she excused herself
to Mary and told her to enjoy herself,
then smilingly left her to her own devices. After
admiring the somber beauty of Edinburgh Castle,
Mary perceived the flowing fountain which splashed
tunefully below her in the garden. She stepped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
on the balcony, a smile of pleasure lighting up her
sweet face. For a while she stood listening to the
rhythmic fall of the water, blissfully unconscious of
the presence of the unseen watcher. Suddenly before
her startled vision there sprang the form of the
gypsy. With a cry of alarm Mary stepped back
and was about to enter the room, when a voice calling
her by name arrested her wondering attention.</p>

<p>“Wait, Mary Campbell!” hissed the voice of the
gypsy.</p>

<p>Mary turned and looked into the white face gazing
up at her so defiantly, and she recognized the
girl to whom she had tossed the money. Suddenly
she gave a gasp of astonishment. “Jean Armour!”
she exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>“Aye, Jean Armour,” repeated the gypsy.
“Come down to me; I must have a word with you
alone,” she whispered sibilantly.</p>

<p>Mary gave a quick look around. Mrs. Dunlop
was still deep in her gossip, and Robert was nowhere
to be seen. She walked to the end of the
balcony and found the steps. Quickly she reached
the bottom, and going to Jean took her two hands
in hers and shook them warmly. She was so glad
to see anyone from Mossgiel, friend or foe.</p>

<p>Jean regarded her advance with sullen suspicion.
“Two years ago I was an invited guest here at Athol
Castle,” she sneered bitterly, “while you were a barefooted
dairymaid in Mossgiel. Now look at us. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
are the lady and I am an outcast, singing on the
streets for my daily bread.”</p>

<p>Mary looked at her in amazement. “But what
has happened?” she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“My father has turned me into the street,” answered
Jean dully.</p>

<p>“Had ye done wrong?” inquired Mary timidly.</p>

<p>Jean laughed mirthlessly. “Wrong?” she repeated,
“aye, if refusing to marry an old man I
detested be wrong.”</p>

<p>“An’ your father turned ye out for that?”</p>

<p>“For that,” she replied stonily, “and because I
refused to give up Robert Burns.”</p>

<p>“But—but ye gave him up long ago, Jean, of
your own free will,” faltered Mary, an awful fear
clutching at her heart. “An’ your father wrote
Robert,” she continued breathlessly, “that ye willingly,
gladly renounced all claims on him, that ye
even hated his name, an’ that ye hoped never to see
or hear o’ him again.”</p>

<p>A look of hatred spread over the face of the
other. “My father lied when he wrote that,” she
cried with bitter intensity, “for I told him I would
never renounce my marriage to Robert, irregular
though it was, and I never will. He is my husband,”
and she glared defiantly at the shrinking girl, who
was looking at her with searching, frightened
eyes. For a moment the poor child stood there like
a lifeless figure as the words stamped themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
one by one on her bewildered brain and sent it reeling
into darkness and vacancy. She felt sick and
dizzy. There was a rushing sound in her ears, the
garden swung round dizzily before her eyes, yet
she stood still, speaking no word, although a quiver
of agony passed over her pallid face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert, my love, have I lost ye again?” she
thought dully. “I knew it was only a dream, too
sweet to last.” There was a choking sensation in her
throat, but she did not weep. As in a horrid dream
she heard the sharp metallic voice hissing in her
ear, “He is my husband, Mary Campbell. You must
give him up to me.” She roused herself out of
the lethargy into which she had fallen, and unclasping
her hands, she wearily pushed back her curls
from her brow and fixed her large pathetic eyes on
Jean, who instinctively shrank back before the
speechless despair of that helpless gaze. “But ye
have no claim on Robbie noo, Jean,” she faltered
slowly, “since your irregular marriage was publicly
dissolved.” She paused and her pale lips quivered.
“Why have ye come here noo to disturb
him?” she asked with infinite pathos. “He is
happy, so happy noo. Dinna destroy that happiness;
go awa’; leave him to me. Ye took him
from me once; dinna separate us again.” Her voice
broke and a hard sob choked her utterance. A great
pity welled up in Jean’s heart for the stricken child,
but she steeled herself against it and remained sullenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
quiet. Presently Mary spoke again. “I hae
nothing in this world, Jean, and I love him so,”
she said with dreamy wistfulness, “better than life
itsel’. We have loved each ither for years, an’
that love has grown stronger an’ stronger as each
year passed by, till noo it’s part o’ my very being.”
Her voice rose to passionate pleading. “Oh, what
is your weak fancy compared to such a love, Jean
Armour?” she asked piteously. “Oh, I tell you I
canna give him up to you again.” She sank down
convulsively on the high-backed bench under the
balcony, her form quivering with low heart-breaking
sobs. Tears of sympathy slowly filled Jean’s eyes
as she watched the grief-stricken girl before her, but
with an angry frown she hardened her heart and
forced herself to think of her own wrongs and pitiable
condition.</p>

<p>“You must give him up!” she answered harshly,
“and to-night.” She paused a moment to watch
the brilliant crowd within the drawing-room, passing
and repassing each other with slow, stately bearing
as they walked with ease and grace through the
dignified measures of the minuet. By and by she
turned to the drooping form and spoke again. “My
God, girl, don’t you suppose I too love him!” she
exclaimed passionately. “Why have I tramped mile
after mile, half starving, subjected to all kinds of
insults, struggling to reach here to see him, if it
were not for that love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary slowly raised her head and looked at her in
reproachful sadness. “Your love has only brought
him, an’ all of us, sorrow and disgrace,” she said
with pathetic simplicity. “He never loved ye, Jean
Armour, ye ken that weel.”</p>

<p>Jean winced at the blunt truth, and a quiver of
anger passed over her defiant face. “I know that
only too well,” she replied bitterly. Then she gave
a little mocking laugh, which nevertheless held a
suggestion of tears. “You may have his heart, Mary
Campbell,” she continued, “but I am what you can
never be, his wife and the mother of his bairns.”</p>

<p>“The bairns,” repeated Mary blankly, “are they
alive, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are alive, thank God!” murmured Jean
softly, “that is why I am here, Mary, that is why
I must demand my rights, for my bairns’ sake.”
Then she continued quickly, feverishly, “Had it not
been for them I would have done my father’s bidding,
would have forgotten Robert, renounced him utterly,
and married the man my father had chosen for me,
but I wanted my little ones to have the protection of
a father’s name, so I stubbornly refused his commands.
After my father had driven me from his
door with curses on his lips, I discovered too late
that Robert had tried again and again to see me,
had even begged my father to allow him to legalize
our marriage, and that his overtures were met with
scorn and abuse. Then I decided to come to Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
myself to tell Robert the truth and to claim
my rights.” She paused defiantly.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn upon her return to the drawing-room
had missed Mary, and upon learning from
Mrs. Dunlop that she was upon the balcony, she
sauntered slowly in that direction. As she stepped
through the window she heard the low murmur of
voices, and looking down perceived with amazement
the young girl seated below her in company with a
fantastically-dressed gypsy. Suddenly, with a start,
she recognized the voice of Jean Armour. Hastily
concealing herself behind a large marble pillar she
listened in growing wonder, her face becoming hard
and repellent, to the direful confession of her god-daughter.</p>

<p>“I arrived in Edinburgh after a month of hardships,”
continued Jean with suppressed excitement,
“and to-night I saw him in all his prosperity entering
the castle like a king, looking so handsome, so
contented, and so very happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is happy noo,” replied Mary softly.
“Happier than he’ll e’er be on earth again, perhaps,”
and she closed her eyes wearily.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, broken only by
the monotonous hum of voices and the faint twanging
of the harp from within the drawing-room. Presently
Mary opened her eyes and spoke again.</p>

<p>“Ye maunna blame Robert for anything at a’,
Jean,” she said loyally. “He thought the bairns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
dead, an’ he believed your father’s words, but noo,
when he kens a’, he will do his duty nobly for his
bairns’ sake.” She smiled bravely into the eager
face of the other. “Ye have the right to him, Jean,
I see that noo,” she continued sadly, “an’—an’ forgive
my rude and unkind words to ye just noo,”
and gently she held out her little hand.</p>

<p>Jean took it tenderly in her own. “What will
you do now, where will you go?” she asked with a
feeling of remorse.</p>

<p>“I shall go back to Colonel Montgomery’s,” replied
Mary, in a sad, spiritless voice, from which all
the life seemed to have fled, “where I can see
my friends sometimes. Mistress Burns loves me, an’
I—I may see Robbie, if only from the window as
he passes. It willna harm anyone.” She looked at
Jean in a pleading, timid manner, while her mouth
quivered pathetically, but she forced a wan smile
to her pale lips and then slowly turned and walked
toward the stairway. As she mounted the bottom
step Jean ran quickly to her side and clasped her
hand impulsively.</p>

<p>“Mary, I’m so sorry for you,” she said pityingly,
“but I’m doing it for my bairns’ sake, ye ken
that.”</p>

<p>“I understand, Jean,” answered Mary simply, “I
dinna blame ye.” She leaned back against the marble
balustrade. “But, oh, it’s hard, bitter hard,” she
murmured brokenly; “if I could only die here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
noo.” She stretched out her hands with a sort of
wild appeal. “Oh, Robbie, my darlin’,” she exclaimed
in a sobbing whisper, “how can I tell ye,
how can I break your heart? I thought ye had
drunk your cup o’ misery empty, but the dregs are
yet to be drained.”</p>

<p>The sympathetic tears rolled down Jean’s face.
“Will you tell him I’m here, Mary, and that I must
see him at once?” she asked pleadingly. Mary
slowly bowed her head in assent. “Oh, how I dread
to meet him,” continued Jean in a frightened whisper,
“to have him look at me with stern and angry eyes;
to know that he longs to be free, and that he wishes
me dead, perhaps.” She covered her face with her
hands and shivered apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Ye needna fear, Jean,” replied Mary, with reproachful
pride. “Robert Burns is a mon of honor;
ye should know that weel. I’ll go noo an’ tell him
ye are here.” For a moment she swayed as if about
to fall, but she recovered herself in an instant and
slowly mounted the few remaining steps to the balcony.
As she reached the top she pressed her hand
against her heart as if that action would still its
rapid beating. “Heaven give me the strength to tell
him,” she breathed, and, with a little prayer on her
lips, she slowly entered the drawing-room, where she
found Mrs. Dunlop anxiously looking for her.</p>

<p>Jean watched her for a few moments, then, with
a sigh of nervous dread, she turned and paced restlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
up and down within the deep shadows beneath
the overhanging trees. She had only taken
one turn when she felt herself seized by the arm and
drawn into the bright moonlight. Smothering the
startled cry of alarm which rose to her lips she
turned and faced her assailant. “Lady Glencairn!”
she gasped, starting back in astonishment.</p>

<p>“So, Jean Armour,” hissed her ladyship, “’tis
you whose name has been coupled so disgracefully
with that of Robert Burns.”</p>

<p>Jean dropped her head quickly, flushing crimson
before the scornful light in the other’s eyes, which
flashed like stars in the pale moonlight that came
streaming down upon them. “Then you have
heard?” she faltered, after a little frightened pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard everything,” her ladyship returned
witheringly, “and my suspicions of you of
two years ago have turned out to be right.”</p>

<p>“Please say no more now, Lady Glencairn,” retorted
Jean sullenly. “Let me go.” She tried to
pass, but Lady Glencairn put a restraining hand
upon her shoulder. “I will say no more, you foolish
girl,” she replied angrily. “Why do you insist
upon thrusting yourself upon Robert Burns, to-night?
He utterly detests your memory. He has
done with you forever.”</p>

<p>Jean looked at her defiantly. “I am his wife. He
must acknowledge me,” she declared firmly.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn laughed scornfully. “You foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
child, do you think he will ever forgive you for
stepping in between him and Mary Campbell again?”
she asked with studied indifference. “No, he would
hate you; you know his erratic temper, my dear Jean;
you would but ruin your chance for a reconciliation
forever, if he sees you now, when his heart is torn by
grief and sorrow at losing for the second time the one
lass who is all the world to him.” She paused and
watched narrowly the look of dread and doubt creep
slowly over the downcast face before her.</p>

<p>By and by Jean looked up, her eyes burning with
unshed tears and shining feverishly. “What shall
I do then, Lady Glencairn?” she asked helplessly,
“where shall I go?”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn did not answer for a few moments.
She was thinking with a thrill of joy that
Jean’s coming would separate the two lovers forever.
“More than likely Robert would now remain in Edinburgh,”
she mused with wildly beating heart. “But,
on the other hand, if he stayed he would quixotically
marry Jean Armour, and publicly right her in the
eyes of the world,” she thought jealously, “and
then——” She broke off and stared at the girl intently.
“If she were out of the way,” she thought
maliciously, “might not his fickle fancy be caught in
the rebound?” These thoughts flowed quickly
through her brain, and her eyes half shut wickedly,
her gleaming white bosom heaving from her hurried
breathing, as she decided on her course. “You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
leave here at once,” she said softly, taking Jean’s
hand with an affectation of tenderness.</p>

<p>“I cannot return to my father,” she replied dully.
“I have nowhere to go now.”</p>

<p>“Go to an inn for to-night,” said her ladyship
hurriedly, “and I’ll come to you in the morning and
advise you as to your future movements, and help
you.”</p>

<p>“But I must see Robert first.”</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn frowned impatiently. “Foolish
girl, take my advice and wait until to-morrow. You
will lose nothing by it, for I will myself plead with
Robert in your behalf.”</p>

<p>Jean did not answer. She stood mute and undecided.</p>

<p>“Surely, my dear Jean,” continued Lady Glencairn
mockingly, “you don’t expect him to proclaim
you as his dearly beloved wife before them all,
do you?” She waved her hand carelessly toward the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Jean flushed and looked away. “No, I didn’t
come for that,” she muttered slowly.</p>

<p>“Then why not do as I advise? I know that when
the keen edge of his grief has worn off he will willingly
take you to his heart and by a church marriage make
you his lawful wife,” and she threw her warm arm
over the shoulders of the yielding girl.</p>

<p>Jean gave a nervous little laugh. “I vow, Lady
Glencairn, I have not the courage to meet him now,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
she said. “I—I thank you gratefully for your
kindness. I—I know ’tis better to wait——” She
paused and sighed dejectedly. “You’ll find me at
the Star and Garter Inn in King’s Court,” she said
quickly after a moment’s indecision. Then she drew
her scarf hurriedly about her shoulders as if anxious
to get away.</p>

<p>At that instant a laughing group of people came
out on the balcony. Lady Glencairn hastily drew
her back in the shadows. “Go, go quickly!” she
whispered, “before you are seen.” With a panting
word of thanks Jean glided through the bushes, and,
skirting the patches of light, she soon reached the
secret door through which she had so unceremoniously
entered and passed out to the street now
deserted, save for the motionless coachmen asleep on
their boxes. Lady Glencairn breathed a sigh of
relief as she watched Jean fade out of sight, swallowed
up in the darkness. “Both out of the way
now,” she murmured, a triumphant smile on her
full crimson lips. She walked quickly toward the
balcony. “What a contemptible creature I have
become,” she thought with careless unconcern.
“And all for love of a low-born peasant,” and she
laughed derisively, as she mounted the steps. She
slowly entered the drawing-room, feeling strangely
nervous and guilty, to find a great many people
going to supper. Robert had grown tired of the
heat and glare and noise, and seeing Mary sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
so weary and wan looking, surrounded by a crowd of
admirers who worshiped at the shrine of youth and
beauty, he crossed quickly and whispered his wishes
to her. She rose gladly and both advanced to bid
their hostess farewell.</p>

<p>“Sorry you cannot remain longer,” said the
Duchess with genuine cordiality. “You must bring
Miss Campbell some afternoon to see me, Mr.
Burns, when I am not receiving the public,” and
with a pleasant smile she bade them good-night.
Slowly they made their way through the crowd and
met Lady Glencairn coming swiftly toward them.</p>

<p>As her eyes rested upon his happy countenance
she knew that he was still in ignorance of Jean’s
arrival in Edinburgh. “Won’t you have some supper?”
she inquired brightly. “Don’t go yet.”</p>

<p>But Robert quietly insisted, as he perceived Mary’s
increasing languor and pallor. So Lady Glencairn,
with anger and disappointment gnawing at her
heart, for she had hoped to show him the beauties
of the garden by moonlight before he went, seeing
that remonstrances were of no avail, bade them both
an effusive good-night. “Don’t forget my garden
party to-morrow,” she said with a patronizing smile,
touching Mary’s cold hand lightly. “I shall expect
you,” and she turned to greet her husband, who was
approaching with Mr. Mackenzie.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, your ladyship,” answered Mary simply,
making a little courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me escort you to the carriage, Miss Campbell,”
said Lord Glencairn, at once offering her his
arm.</p>

<p>“And allow me to follow,” added Mr. Mackenzie,
slipping his arm through Robert’s, to whom he whispered,
“How dare you, sir, how dare you be such
a provokingly happy man in this miserable old
world?” Robert laughed, and they all walked slowly
down to the carriage, conversing gayly on their
way.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mary stopped with a little exclamation
of dismay. “We’ve forgotten Mrs. Dunlop,” she
said contritely.</p>

<p>With a laugh Lord Glencairn dispatched a footman
to find her, and the good lady soon appeared,
flushed and panting from her hurried departure.
With a last handshake all around Robert sprang in
beside them and within a couple of minutes the carriage
was out of sight.</p>

<p>“Ye were the queen of the evening, Mary, just
as I told ye ye’d be,” said Robert triumphantly.
“Have ye enjoyed yoursel’?”</p>

<p>“Ay, for a whiley,” answered Mary listlessly,
leaning back against the heavy padding of the seat,
with eyes heavy and sad. She had had no opportunity
as yet to tell Robert the dread news, and her
heart was filled with misgivings as she thought of
Jean waiting patiently in the garden for him to
come to her. She started up suddenly, resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tell him, but the sight of his happy face, and the
presence of Mrs. Dunlop, cooled her courage, and
she leaned back again silent and miserable. If she
didn’t tell him to-night what would Jean do? With
her usual unselfishness she gave no thought to self.
She was miserably unhappy, but she would not allow
herself to think of her own sufferings. Her whole
thought was of him and the darkness into which he
would soon be plunged, and of Jean and her bairns,
Robert’s bairns. She sighed quiveringly, and a little
pang of jealousy shot through her heart like a breath
of fire, but it soon passed away and left only a dull
ache that would always be there now, she thought
wearily, as they rolled along toward home. She
clasped her hands together feverishly. “Should she
whisper to him now, tell him all and bid him drive back
to Jean?” she asked herself in an agony of indecision.
At that moment the carriage stopped at the door
of Mrs. Dunlop’s mansion. It was too late now.
She gave a little sigh of relief, though her heart
was filled with grief and anxiety. Robert escorted
her to the door, with loving pride in her daintiness, in
her sweet air of refinement. She looked very frail and
spirituelle, as she turned to him quietly and bade
him good-night.</p>

<p>“Has something gone wrong, Mary?” he inquired
solicitously, noticing with alarm her wan face,
her languid air of weariness.</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly, not daring to trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
her voice. Mrs. Dunlop put her arm about her
fondly.</p>

<p>“The lassie is tired, Robert,” she said in her
motherly way, “and no wonder. She’ll be as bright
as a lark in the morning.” Bidding them both a
tender good-night, he turned and ran down the steps,
jumped into the carriage, and drove off toward his
chambers, whistling softly to himself the tune of
“Mary of Argyle.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p>The next day a grand garden party was given at
Glencairn Hall. All Edinburgh was invited, and
they came eagerly to see the great poet, who was on
the eve of leaving the social world to retire to his
farm in Ayrshire, and to see Highland Mary, the
dainty, flower-like sweetheart of their idol. The
grounds looked very bright and gay. Refreshment
booths of red and white canvas were dotted here and
there on the smooth velvet lawns. Bright flags of all
nations waved from different parts of the gardens—signals
of putting, archery, and dancing—and the
seductive music of the Queen’s theater orchestra rose
up and joined the songs of birds and the tinkle of the
fountains in full play. Girls in light summer costumes
were grouped picturesquely beneath the stately oaks
and beeches. Gay laughter echoed from the leafy
shrubberies, and stray couples were seen sauntering
carelessly through the rose gardens, too much absorbed
in each other to notice what was going on
around them.</p>

<p>Presently out of the same rose garden a man
walked hurriedly, followed by a woman, who quickly
overtook him, to his perceptible annoyance. They
were Sir William Creech and Eppy McKay. Eppy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
looked exceedingly ugly in the full glare of the bright
sun. She was dressed in a brilliant plaid gown, the
style of which seemed to accentuate her angularity;
and a huge Gainsborough hat was perched jauntily
upon her towering court wig. Her small green eyes
looked coquettishly at her irate companion. He
stopped and glared at her fiercely.</p>

<p>“But I desire to take a smoke,” he said wrathfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t object to smoke, Sir William,” she
tittered coyly.</p>

<p>He looked about him wildly as if seeking some
means of escape from his admirer. “But I wish
to be alone,” he cried almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and regarded him reproachfully.
“Oh, you are joking, Sir William, but you
cannot scare me away.”</p>

<p>With a groan of despair he continued his walk, hoping
to escape from his persistent admirer. “Great
heavens! I’ll go daft yet,” he muttered as he perceived
her close at his elbow. For a few minutes he puffed
furiously at his pipe, casting angry glances from
time to time at his unwelcome companion, who trotted
along so contentedly at his side. Finally Sir
William concluded that he could not elude her attentions
for the time being, so decided to make the best of
the infliction. “Do I go too fast for you?” he asked
maliciously, as he heard her puffing away vigorously
beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed,” she replied with a little breathless
giggle. “You couldn’t go too fast for me, for I
am as light and quick on my feet as ever I was. In
faith, why shouldn’t I be?” she continued gayly.
“I am only 32. You see I am so much younger than
you.”</p>

<p>He snorted angrily. “Well, you don’t look it,”
he retorted. She stopped short and looked at him
in amazed indignation.</p>

<p>“What?” she quavered, a little out of breath,
“I don’t look younger than you?”</p>

<p>At the sign of approaching tears, Sir William
frowned impatiently. “I mean you don’t look—32,”
he said diplomatically.</p>

<p>She simpered and thanked him for the compliment.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly as he said to himself, “She’s
over 60 if she’s a day.”</p>

<p>“They all tell me I don’t look my age,” she said
gushingly. “It’s my artistic soul that keeps me so
young and fresh-looking.” They sat down on a
bench, glad of the opportunity to cool themselves
after their strenuous walk. “Do you know,” she
said dreamily, fanning herself, “I am very different
from most artistic people.” He looked at her. “Oh
my, yes, indeed!” she affirmed convincingly. “I
don’t live in the clouds, I am of the earth earthy,”
and she gave him another languishing look.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t tell me,” he retorted mockingly.</p>

<p>“But I love art,” sighed Eppy ecstatically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
“When I was young,” she went on reminiscently,
“I mean when I was younger,” she corrected herself
with a startled look at her silent companion, “I came
near having a painting from my own hand hung in
the National Gallery.”</p>

<p>“You are a clever woman,” he remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>“It was this way,” she explained volubly. “I
had painted a lovely marine. I do marines much
better than anything else,” with a self-conscious
smirk, “and upon showing it to Mr. William Nichol,
a dear man, but one who drinks to excess, he promised
to mention it to the Lord Mayor. Well, it made
me exceedingly nervous, I vow. However, I bought
a most lovely frame for it, Nile green in color, with
sweet red plush ends.” She cleared her throat affectedly
and continued with evident delight. “I do like
things to match,” she explained, “and the green was
the exact shade of the water. It was simply exquisite.”
She clasped her hands together and rolled her
eyes heavenward. “And the red ends exactly
matched the cow, which was a lovely shade of——”</p>

<p>“Cow?” echoed Sir William in amazement.
“Did I hear you say cow?”</p>

<p>Eppy looked at him pettishly. She didn’t like to
be so violently interrupted. “Certainly a cow,”
she returned frigidly. “Is there anything strange
in a cow?” and she drew herself up with an injured
air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, there’s nothing strange in a cow when it
is by itself,” replied Sir William dryly, “but in a
marine, well, it is a little hard on the cow.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are saying, Sir William,”
flashed Eppy indignantly. “Please don’t
interrupt me again. The cow I have reference to was
in one corner drinking. I heard Lady Nancy Gordon
telling Mrs. McLehose that the cow looked as if
it were trying to drink the ocean dry; the idea!”
and she clucked her tongue against her teeth in contemptuous
scorn. “She’s a cat,” she continued
spitefully; “I never could bear her. She was uncommon
jealous of me, yes, indeed, but that’s another
matter.”</p>

<p>Sir William turned crimson, and seemed about to
choke, as he tried to smother his laughter. “You
were telling me about your marine,” he finally stuttered.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry me, Sir William,” said Eppy
coquettishly. “Well, I took it to Lord Mundobbo.
You know whom I mean; at that time he had something
to do with the National Gallery; Mr. Nichol
didn’t inform me as to his exact connection with it.”
She paused and gazed soulfully into space. “Shall
I ever forget the day? The sun was high in the
heavens—but there,” she broke off with a deprecating
smile. “I really must restrain my poetic impulse.
But as I was saying,” she rambled on quickly, “the
sky was overcast and threatening snow——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought the sun was shining, Miss McKay,”
interrupted Sir William gruffly.</p>

<p>She was beginning to get on his nerves again. “I
am a little mixed in my metaphors,” apologized
Eppy condescendingly, “but you flustrate me so,
Sir William,” and she tapped him playfully with her
fan. “Well, I felt that victory was mine. I took
off the paper—it was pink, tied with a yellow string—and
laid it before him.” She paused impressively,
then she continued in an elocutionary tone of voice.
“He gazed at it long and silently. He was simply
speechless. I knew he’d be. I said to him, ‘Lord
Mundobbo, as much as it grieves me to part with my—ahem—masterpiece,
for the sake of art I will permit
you to add it to the collection of paintings in the
National Gallery.’ Said he, ‘Miss McKay, really I
appreciate this honor you do me and the National
Gallery. It is a masterpiece of its kind, but I cannot
accept it.’”</p>

<p>“The brute!” exclaimed Sir William in mock
anger. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“He said if I would change the ocean into a fresh
water pond and give the cow a chance, he might
consider it,” and Eppy tearfully regarded her now
laughing companion with an aggrieved air.</p>

<p>“Did ye do it?” inquired Sir William, rising to
his feet.</p>

<p>“Did I do it!” repeated Eppy with horror expressed
in every tone of her voice, every feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
her pointed face. “No, sir,” she replied emphatically.
“Never would I willingly spoil a work of art.
That was my first and only. I couldn’t improve on
it. But my artistic soul was smothered, and now
another, a poetic spirit has taken its place.” She
smiled dreamily, a sigh of content escaping her
parted lips.</p>

<p>“A case of the survival of the fittest, eh?” he
retorted brusquely.</p>

<p>For a moment they walked on in silence, Sir William
wondering how to get rid of the incubus, and
Eppy happy over the impression she fondly imagined
she had made upon Sir William. Just then a bend
in the avenue brought them in full view of the broad
terrace in front of the hall, where Robert’s handsome
figure was outlined clearly against the dazzling blue
of the sky. Several people were grouped near him.
He seemed to be in animated conversation with some
of them, and his face was radiant with smiles. With
a cry of delight, Eppy hurried forward to greet him,
forgetting Sir William utterly, much to his amazement.
That she, or anyone, would dare leave him so
unceremoniously to join Robert Burns angered him
beyond measure. He followed her slowly at some little
distance, with no very pleasant expression on his
stern features.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon when it was close to sunset,
and all other amusements had given way to
the delight of dancing Sir Roger de Coverly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
springy green turf to the silvery music of the
orchestra, Mary and Mrs. Dunlop put in their
appearance. Mary was looking very beautiful in a
clinging, old-fashioned white crepe de chene, another
old relic of Mrs. Dunlop’s dead and gone slim youth.
While they danced, she reclined languidly in a low
chair, her sad eyes fixed mournfully upon Robert’s
glowing face as he lay stretched in lazy length
at her feet. The day had passed and still she had had
no opportunity to tell him the dire news, for she had
not seen him since the night before.</p>

<p>While the dancing was in progress a liveried page
walked noiselessly over the turf and stopping beside
the recumbent figure of the poet, quietly handed him
a note. He leisurely opened it and read it at a
glance. “Say I’ll be right there,” he said to the
waiting page after a moment’s meditation. He
excused himself to Mary and the others and followed
the man indoors, with a frown of impatient wonder
clouding his brow.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of a noble maple, Lady Glencairn
was seated in earnest conversation with her
uncle. Her ladyship was looking exceedingly beautiful
in a pink-flowered summer silk, which puffed and
billowed around her, with a bunch of white heather
at her breast and a wreath of the same dainty flowers
in her picturesque Leghorn hat. She held a pink-lined
parasol over her head, and from under the
protecting shadow her dark lustrous eyes flashed disdainfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
as she regarded her scolding companion.
Suddenly she gave a start and leaned forward to
watch the group opposite. She had noticed the quiet
entrance of the servant and the immediate departure
of the poet, and idly wondered who it was that
desired to see Robert on such urgent business that
they must needs follow him here. The minutes
passed and still he did not return. She was growing
anxious. “Suppose”—and she started violently at
the sudden thought—“suppose it was by some unfortunate
chance Jean Armour herself?” She rose
quickly to her feet, with a word of apology and
after a quick look around, in which she noticed Mary’s
pale face and restless manner, she walked leisurely
toward the house. Once inside she rang for the page
and upon questioning him learned that the young
woman who had insisted on seeing Mr. Burns, and who
was none other than Jean Armour, as she concluded
from the man’s description, had just gone, and that
Mr. Burns was now seated in the drawing-room alone.
Hastily dismissing him, she stole softly into the
parlors, and there beside the table, his face in his
hands, sat Robert, his shoulders heaving convulsively.
She looked at him a moment and the tears
of pity came into her luminous eyes. Then softly
she walked to his side and laid her cool hand upon
his feverish head. “Robert, I am so sorry for you,”
she said gently.</p>

<p>He lifted his head with a start and rose quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to his feet. It didn’t occur to him to ask what she
meant or to inquire how she knew what had happened
in that room, and she was secretly glad that he demanded
no explanation. “Where is she?” he asked
dully.</p>

<p>“She has gone,” she answered quickly. “I—I met
her at the door and offered to assist her, gave her
money and advised her not to make any unnecessary
scandal in town, but to return to her home at once.
You know she is my godchild. So she promised to
go, and I presume she is now on her way.” She
looked him straight in the eyes as she glibly told this
falsehood. She didn’t know what arrangements he
had made with Jean, but she daringly made the lying
explanation, confident that he would believe it, for he
could have no possible reason for suspecting her
motives, or any means of finding out at present that
she had not indeed met Jean, who might have altered
her plans at the last moment.</p>

<p>A look of anger came over his face for a moment,
then as quickly died away, and his eyes filled with a
hopeless, despairing look. He walked slowly to the
window, his hands clenched together behind him, and
stood there, pale and miserable and wretched, gazing
out upon the scene of happiness he had just left.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn watched him with eyes filled with
passion, and her heart beat with painful thuds as she
fought against the desperate longing to throw herself
into his arms and comfort him. She glided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
quickly to his side and put her hand gently within
his arm and stood there in sympathetic silence although
she was consumed with jealousy as she
watched his melancholy eyes riveted on the fair
face of his lost sweetheart. For a while they stood
there in gloomy quiet. Presently a deep, heartrending
sigh, which was almost a sob, escaped his
trembling lips.</p>

<p>“An’ we were so happy a few minutes ago,” he
murmured brokenly. “An’ noo ’tis all over.” He
paused and bit his lips convulsively. Presently he
went on in a dull, low tone as if speaking to himself,
“How true it is, there’s many a slip ’twixt cup
and lip.” Lady Glencairn pressed his arm tenderly,
but remained silent. “What have I to live
for noo?” he continued with despairing mournfulness.</p>

<p>“Everything, Robert,” murmured her ladyship
tenderly, gazing up into his face with glittering eyes.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her in wonder. As he
saw the feverish flush on her face, felt her hot breath
on his cheek, he remembered with a start her peculiar
words and meaning looks at Athol Castle the
night before. Lady Glencairn noted with apprehension
the look of stern coldness spread quickly over his
face, and the nervous tears of disappointment and
passionate longing welled up in her eyes. Then with
reckless abandon she dropped her head against his
shoulder and let the tears flow unrestrainedly. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
moment Robert stood there speechless with surprise
and horror, for he knew at last that what he had
vaguely feared was an indisputable fact; knew that
his hostess, the wife of his dearest friend and counsellor,
entertained a guilty passion for him. It filled
him with righteous anger that she would willingly betray
the love and confidence of the noblest gentleman
in the kingdom. He placed the weeping woman in a
chair and stood looking down upon her with a frown
of displeasure. “Lady Glencairn,” he said coldly,
“if these tears are for my unhappy fate, I thank ye
for your sympathy.”</p>

<p>She caught his hand and held it tightly within
her arm. “Oh, no, no, Robert, ’tis not that,” she
whispered passionately. “Do you not remember the
Lady of the Lake I told you of last evening?” He
made no reply. Then she continued slowly, her voice
low and shaking, “Read my fate in that of hers.”</p>

<p>Still he would not understand her. “I fear I do
not understand your meaning, my lady,” he replied,
trying to withdraw his hand from her grasp, but
she held it firmly.</p>

<p>“Cannot your heart understand mine?” she cried
recklessly. “Does it not pity my wretchedness?”</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. He knew he could
no longer parry with her, for her words and meaning
were too plain to admit of any misunderstanding.
He turned to her, his face set and firm. “Lady
Glencairn,” he said sternly, “you dishonor yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
by such madness, and all for naught. My heart is
noo numb with sorrow, it could feel no throb of
yours, even were I vile enough to see no evil in usurping
your husband’s rights.”</p>

<p>“Do not remind me of my unhappiness!” she
exclaimed impatiently. “I married him when I was
a girl, before I knew what love was. Then you came
into my life, and I knew that the fire of love was
not dead within me.” Her rich seductive voice
trembled with passion.</p>

<p>“I pray you cease!” he entreated her, but she
went on rapidly.</p>

<p>“Let me speak, Robert!” she cried, clinging to
him frantically. “I can no longer contain myself,
for I love you better than my life, better than my
honor, my good name; I care not for them now.
Oh, pity me, pity me!” and she flung herself down
on her knees before him and burst into a storm of
irrepressible weeping.</p>

<p>Robert looked around apprehensively. The
thought that someone might suddenly enter the
room filled him with alarmed dismay. With a quick
movement he raised her to her feet, and his voice
trembled with deep feeling when he next spoke. “I
do pity you,” he said sorrowfully, “but I pity your
husband more, when he learns of your faithlessness.”
He paused and regarded her with reproachful sadness.
“Oh, why have you severed forever the threads
of our friendship by such imprudence, such rashness?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
As he finished he bowed his head and walked
slowly toward the door.</p>

<p>“Do not leave me like this!” she panted desperately.
“Can’t you see you are killing me by your
coldness.” She held out her arms in piteous entreaty
as she continued tenderly, “Tell me you didn’t mean
it, Robert. Say you are but testing my love for
you.”</p>

<p>He turned on her quickly and at his look of
contemptuous scorn she drooped her head and the
hot blood rushed to her face. “Are you lost to all
sense of prudence, honor and decency?” he cried in
scathing accents. “Heaven knows I’m no moralist,
no saint,” and he gave a mirthless little laugh as he
thought of the opinion Edinburgh had formed concerning
his morality—then he went on firmly, solemnly,
“But I would sooner cut this erring heart of
mine out of this body than fall so low as to betray the
honor of my friend who trusts me.” She started
to speak again, but he raised his hand quickly.
“Say no more, Lady Glencairn,” he said with calm
dignity, “an’ I’ll forget this distressing conversation,
and continue thro’ life to respect equally with
himself, the wife of my friend.”</p>

<p>Slowly the warm color faded from her cheeks,
leaving her ashy pale, while through her suddenly
narrowed eyelids a vindictive light gleamed tigerishly.</p>

<p>“You’ve said enough!” she hissed through her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
clenched teeth. “I have lowered myself to you as
I would to no other man living, only to be scorned
and humiliated. God!” she laughed wildly, hysterically,
and threw herself face downward upon the
ottoman. “Fool, fool!” she cried with bitter self-abasement.
“How I hate and despise myself for
what I have done; would I had died before I had
uttered such damning words,” and she beat her
jeweled hands frantically against the cushions.</p>

<p>“I beseech you to be careful, Lady Glencairn,”
cried Robert in amazed alarm, going to her.</p>

<p>She turned on him fiercely. “You, of all men,
posing as a model of virtue and goodness, prating of
husband’s honor, wife’s duty.” She measured him
with a scornful, sneering glance of fury. “You,
who have the name of making love to every female
in petticoats who crosses your path, you hypocrite!”</p>

<p>Robert fixed his eyes upon her in silence and the
utter scorn of the look stung her heart to its center.
Presently he controlled his anger sufficiently to be
able to speak, and still eying her with that straight,
keen look of immeasurable disdain, he said in cold,
deliberate accents, “Your ladyship has been misinformed
as to my past conduct. I do not claim
to be more than human, but I know my name is as
yet clear from the taint of dishonor.”</p>

<p>“You poor fool, you country yokel!” she stormed
furiously, walking up and down between him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the door like a caged lioness. “Did you think you
could scorn such a woman as I with impunity? Do
you think I will stand the humiliation of being repulsed,
despised, shamed? I tell you no, no, never;
’tis but a step from love to hate, you should
know that.” She paused in her nervous walking and
stood facing him, her eyes ablaze with the uttermost
anger, her beautiful figure drawn rigidly erect.
“You shall be made to feel the depth of my hatred
before long, Robert Burns,” she threatened, and
there came a dangerous gleam in the flashing, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“I shall leave Edinburgh within the hour,”
replied Robert quietly. Was there ever such another
unfortunate being as himself? he thought grimly, and
a wave of unutterable sadness rushed over him.</p>

<p>“Aye, that you will,” retorted her ladyship with
a sneering, bitter laugh. “But not as you anticipate,
with the plaudits of the world ringing in your ears.
Instead of that, only contemptuous silence will greet
your departure as you leave here in shame and disgrace,
and when you have sunk once more into poverty
and oblivion, you will repent bitterly ever
having made an enemy of Alice Glencairn.” As
these words left her lips, she swept haughtily past
him like an outraged queen and left the room, leaving
him standing there like one in a trance.</p>

<p>He brushed his hands across his eyes as if to assure
himself that he was awake, that he wasn’t the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of some hideous hallucination, but no, he was painfully
conscious of the reality of it all. He heaved a
deep sigh and sank wearily into a chair, his eyes
riveted upon the floor in melancholy meditation. A
little cry aroused him from the profound gloom into
which his thoughts were plunged and looking fearfully
up, dreading lest her ladyship had returned,
his eyes rested upon the white, startled face of Highland
Mary. She had watched him leave the grounds
with listless curiosity, which changed to wonder and
dismay when Lady Glencairn rose from her seat and
sauntered toward the hall. For some minutes she
nervously sat there wondering vaguely why he stayed
so long and why her ladyship had followed him.
Presently she rose and mechanically made her way
over the springy sward toward the house. She
couldn’t have told why she went or what she intended
to do. She wondered in a vague way if Robert’s
message could in any way concern Jean, but her
thoughts dwelt longer upon the suspicions that had
been raised in her innocent heart against her beautiful
hostess, for she had recognized her as the bogus
Lady Nancy in spite of the disguising mask, suspicions
that filled her with uneasiness and alarm; and
yet why should she be jealous? She told herself sadly
she had renounced him forever, given him back to
Jean, and in a few days she would pass out of his
life forever. Oh, the agony that pierced her heart
at the recollection of her past happiness! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
fleeting it had been—scarcely a week. She had
drawn near the window by this time quite unconsciously.
Suddenly the sound of voices within the
room made her pause. She had not thought to listen
nor meant to, but when she heard the passionate
pleading voice of her ladyship and the stern replies
from Robert, a feeling of fascinated horror took
possession of her, rooting her to the spot. Motionless
she stood there and heard all that passed within
the room. And when the voices stopped and all was
deathly still, she peered through the window. At the
sight of her dear one sitting there all alone, with
that look of intense suffering on his face, her heart
cried out to him in sympathy. Quickly she opened
the high French window and noiselessly stepped into
the room. For a moment she stood watching him,
her eyes filled with patient sorrow, infinite pity, and
a world of loving compassion. Involuntarily a deep
sigh escaped her. As he raised his head she went
quietly up to him and placed a tender hand upon his
arm. After one quick, heart-broken look at her
he buried his face in his hands again.</p>

<p>“Dinna distress yoursel’, laddie; I have known
since last night at Athol Castle that our happy
dream was ended.” She felt him stiffen beneath her
touch. “Jean came to me in the gardens,” she
explained with patient resignation. “I should have
told ye last night, for she was waiting for ye
to come to her, but I—I hadna’ the courage.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
There was silence for a moment, then he spoke in a
low, spiritless tone.</p>

<p>“Jean said that ye knew all,” he said without
looking up. They remained quiet after that,
plunged in bitter thought. There was nothing they
could say to comfort each other, the wound was bleeding
too freely as yet. Presently Robert raised his
head, and with a despairing gesture pushed the heavy
curls back from his fevered brow and rose unsteadily
to his feet. They must get away at once, he thought
feverishly. He took Mary by the hand and started
for the door, when from the open window he heard
his name called. Turning apprehensively he beheld
Sir William Creech entering, followed by Lord Glencairn
and several of his guests. In his hand Sir
William held a newspaper, while a hard smile of
triumph wrinkled his stem face.</p>

<p>“I told ye, Robert Burns, ye would overreach
yourself,” he cried jubilantly, shaking the newspaper
at him.</p>

<p>Robert looked at him apathetically. “Ye were
ever a bird of ill omen,” he said quietly. “What
have I done noo?”</p>

<p>“You have seen fit to sign your name to an article
in this paper, which has aroused the indignation of
all Edinburgh,” replied Sir William without any
preamble. “’Tis a most seditious article and shows
that ye have embraced the doctrines of the French
Revolution.”</p>

<p>“A man has a perfect right to his opinion,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Mrs. Dunlop decidedly, giving Sir William a scornful
look.</p>

<p>“Indeed he has,” echoed Eppy, nodding her head
briskly. “I mean to stick to mine.”</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn turned and looked searchingly at
Robert’s pale, gloomy face. “Is that true, Robert?”
he asked gently.</p>

<p>Robert did not reply. He seemed not to hear, in
fact.</p>

<p>“’Tis a most serious charge, Mr. Burns,” remarked
Mr. Sterne gravely.</p>

<p>“If it be true,” retorted Mr. Mackenzie loyally.</p>

<p>“Which is not at all likely,” flashed Eppy indignantly.</p>

<p>She would believe nothing wrong of her hero,
even if it were proven in black and white.</p>

<p>“But listen!” continued Sir William eagerly.
He scanned the article through quickly until he found
what he sought. “Ah, here it is. It is stated here
that Mr. Burns refused to stand up in the theater
recently when ‘God save the King’ was being
played,” and he glared about him indignantly.</p>

<p>A quiet sneer curled Robert’s lips. “Anything
else?” he asked sarcastically. “Out wi’ it or the
venom of your spleen will poison ye,” and he fixed
his eyes upon Sir William with disdainful indifference.</p>

<p>“And there is more,” snarled Sir William. “’Tis
known that ye have sent two cannon to the French
Directorate with a complimentary letter, offering
further assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, impossible.” cried Lord Glencairn
incredulously.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Sir William vindictively,
“there’s also a full account here which explains
much of Mr. Burns’ reprehensible conduct here in
town, as well as in Ayrshire, where it seems his
amours were as numerous and questionable as they
are at the present time.”</p>

<p>“For shame, Creech!” cried Lord Glencairn with
indignation.</p>

<p>“How fascinating he must have been even when a
farmer,” giggled Eppy aside to Mrs. Dunlop, who
was casting indignant glances at Sir William.</p>

<p>“’Tis a libelous article,” she flashed angrily,
“and I for one do not believe a word of it. Robert,”
she said, turning to the silent figure standing
so pale and calm before his inquisitors, “deny this
absurd charge before it is given further credence!”</p>

<p>“He cannot deny it,” said Sir William. “His
name is at the bottom of it,” and he held it up to
their view.</p>

<p>“And I’ll attempt no denial,” replied Robert in
a full ringing voice, “for I know it would be useless.
Know, then, that I do sympathize with the
French people in their struggle for freedom, and I
did help them all that lay in my power. I hope
that France may gain the prize for which she is
fighting, a free and independent republic, and that
she may set up her standard of liberty and independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
as did the United States of America, when
they were delivered from the toils of the British.”</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence when he had finished
his declaration. His amazed and incredulous
listeners could hardly believe they had heard him
aright. They looked aghast at each other, not
knowing just how to take it. Their embarrassed
silence was soon broken, however.</p>

<p>“Ye hear those seditious sentiments,” cried Sir
William in an I-told-you-so tone of voice.</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn shook his head gravely. “’Tis
dangerous to speak thus, Robert,” he said with
solemn earnestness. “You should be careful——”</p>

<p>“Careful of what?” interrupted Robert with
impatient scorn. “Lest I offend people with my
plain speaking of the truth?” He paused and looked
around him with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils.
“Who is careful of my feelings?” he demanded.
“Not those who think themselves my superiors by
accident of birth.” He turned to Sir William
Creech and continued quickly, his voice vibrating
with suppressed indignation. “I’ve never wronged
ye, Sir William Creech, yet ye are miscreant enough
to seek my ruin, for I’m fair sure ’twas ye yourself
who inserted that scurrilous article in that paper ye
hold in your hand, in which my faults, my past
errors and follies are now being aired.”</p>

<p>Sir William turned a sickly color. “Think what
you like,” he muttered savagely. “’Tis time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
people of Edinburgh knew the character of the man
they are honoring.”</p>

<p>“Sir William Creech, you are an old brute!”
cried Eppy, her little gray eyes flashing fire, and
going up to him she continued in haughty disdain,
“Remember, sir, I will have naught to do with you
in the future; I turn my back on you,” and she suited
the action to the word.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Robert had spoken in an undertone to
Mrs. Dunlop, and that good soul, putting an arm
around Mary, who stood white and trembling like a
frightened child, walked to the door, and Robert, after
a formal inclination of his head, started quietly
but proudly after them. They had reached the door,
when it suddenly opened and Lady Glencairn stood
upon the threshold, her head held haughtily erect,
her lips curled in a disdainful sneer. She entered the
room and closed the door behind her, then turned and
faced the wondering group which was being augmented
by the entrance, through the window, of a
number of the guests whose curiosity had been
aroused by the unusual scene to which they had been
listening in speechless amazement.</p>

<p>“Alice, what has happened?” cried Lord Glencairn
in an alarmed voice. Her ladyship’s white,
nervous face, the peculiar glitter in her eyes, startled
him out of his usual calmness.</p>

<p>“James, I am deeply sorry to wound you,” she
began nervously, “but it’s best that you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
know how grievously you have been betrayed by one
of your honored guests here to-day,” and she fixed
her narrowed eyes upon the startled face of Robert
Burns.</p>

<p>A great fear of impending danger came over him
as he saw the revengeful look which she flashed at him,
and he involuntarily straightened himself as if to
receive a shock. There was a surprised movement
among the crowd, and a low murmur of many voices
broke the tense stillness which followed her accusation.</p>

<p>“I—betrayed?” repeated Lord Glencairn, in astonishment.
“What mean you, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” she answered, and the lie rolled glibly
off her crimson lips, “that your distinguished guest,
Robert Burns, has to-day wantonly and without provocation
grossly insulted the wife of his friend and
host.” As the ignoble lie left her lips, there was an
audible indrawn breath of startled surprise from
the amazed listeners. Then they turned and fixed
their wondering gaze upon the accused man, who,
after an inarticulate exclamation of horror, stood as
though carved out of stone.</p>

<p>“I for one do not believe it,” cried Mrs. Dunlop
indignantly, and she returned Lady Glencairn’s look
of haughty displeasure with a withering glance of
scornful disbelief.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” echoed Eppy, with a youthful toss of
her head.</p>

<p>“What was the nature of the insult, Alice?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
asked Lord Glencairn gravely. No doubt she had
taken offense where no offense was intended, he
thought indulgently.</p>

<p>Before she could answer, Robert stepped quickly
up to her with flashing eyes and lips trembling with
anger. “Madam, that I have had the misfortune
to offend ye, I am sorrowfully aware,” he said with
bitter sarcasm, “but that I have been guilty of
offering ye an insult, none knows better than yourself
how little cause ye have to accuse me of such
monstrous ingratitude, such a contemptible betrayal
of the laws of hospitality. I am quite willing that
you should repeat every word of the conversation
that passed between us in the room a few minutes
since, and if aught that I have said can be construed
as an insult to your ladyship, then do I stand ready
and whiling to abide by the consequence of such an
indiscretion.” He looked her straight in the eyes,
and with folded arms calmly waited for her to
speak.</p>

<p>Not long did she return the look, however, for the
utter scorn of it stung her guilty heart to its core.
Not that she felt any compunction for what she was
doing—her whole soul was up in arms against him,
and she would not stop until she had meted out her
spiteful revenge upon him to the fullest extent. His
evident contemptuous defiance irritated her beyond
measure—she was angrier with him than ever—already
she had a sort of strange feeling of triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
at the vengeance she had designed, for she knew that
her word would be believed against his; even now
she could read suspicion and conviction in many of
the serious faces that surrounded her, much to her
satisfaction. He had thrown down the challenge,
had he? Well, she would take it up. No one knew
what had passed between them save themselves, and
no one would ever know the truth, and the truth
would now be a very small factor in working out
her present scheme of vengeance. All these thoughts
flashed quickly through her mind, and her answer
was ready on her lips almost soon as he had finished
speaking. With well-simulated indignation she drew
herself haughtily away from him, with a gesture of
repulsion. “Dare you deny your protestations of
love and devotion?” she replied. “Why, my lord,”
she continued scornfully, turning to her husband, who
was now regarding Robert with serious, thoughtful
eyes, a look of wounded pride and deepening sorrow
gradually shadowing his noble countenance, “before
I could stop him he had fallen upon his knees
and begged me to be false to you, and to give him my
love, my favors.”</p>

<p>“Great God!” cried Robert, staggering back,
white and speechless, while a wave of the blackest
despair engulfed him completely, for he knew that
the outrageous lie had sealed his doom as utterly as
though it had been the truth; knew that all denials
from him would be useless in the face of that accusation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
He sank back into a chair in helpless resignation,
his independent spirit, his haughty pride
wounded almost unto death.</p>

<p>When Mary heard the lying accusation she
started forward with a little cry on her lips. Freeing
herself from Mrs. Dunlop’s restraining hand, she
took a few steps toward Lord Glencairn, her face
aglow with indignation, her timidity, her fear of
the great ones surrounding her, forgotten for the
moment, as she sought to defend the man she loved.</p>

<p>“My lord!” she cried thrillingly, “’tis not true;
Robbie did not insult her ladyship, for I——”</p>

<p>But, with an angry flush, Lady Glencairn interrupted
her. “I say he did,” she retorted harshly.
Then, as Mrs. Dunlop drew the frightened girl away,
she continued with insulting emphasis, “James, bid
this man and his virtuous Highland Mary begone
at once! Their presence here is an insult to respectable
people,” and she flashed them a malicious
look.</p>

<p>“Alice, Alice!” exclaimed Lord Glencairn, in
accents of deep reproach, “that is unworthy of
you.”</p>

<p>Robert felt as though he must choke with fury.
He forgot the presence of Lord Glencairn. He forgot
everything but his just indignation. “My
God!” he cried passionately, striding up to the
sneering woman, “you dare to speak so—you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I!” she returned coolly, eying him disdainfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
up and down. “What have you to say
against me?” She drew herself up imperiously.</p>

<p>“Only this,” replied Robert in a low, tense voice,
“ye may say what you will of me, but as ye value
your happiness, do not breathe aught against the
fair name of Mary Campbell.”</p>

<p>She uttered an angry exclamation, but remained
speechless and so pale that her lips were devoid of
color. If he were dishonorable enough to tell everything,
she thought, with a thrill of fear, it would
make things decidedly embarrassing and humiliating
for her, besides giving her enemies a choice bit
of scandal, which they would use to excellent advantage.</p>

<p>At this point a few of the guests, feeling decidedly
uncomfortable and very much <i>de trop</i>, quietly left
the room, but the others, and the room was filled,
held their ground, shamelessly reveling in the extraordinary
scene, the like of which had never before
been seen in an Edinburgh drawing-room, which
was being enacted before them.</p>

<p>“Robert, lad,” whispered Mrs. Dunlop, in a loud
aside, “ye must say something. Deny this charge.
I know you are innocent of any wrong doing.
Speak, tell his lordship so!” and she pointed to
where he stood crushed and silent, in speechless
sorrow.</p>

<p>“What can I say, Mrs. Dunlop?” replied Robert,
in an agony of indecision. “Would ye have me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
flatly contradict her ladyship and accuse her of
lying?” He paused a moment with patient sadness.
“Nay, nay, friend, there is nothing I can say noo
that will smooth matters or clear me in the eyes of
the world.”</p>

<p>“But you must tell them the truth,” insisted
Mary. “Dinna’ let them believe this monstrous thing
of you.” She looked indignantly at the cold repellent
face of her ladyship, and continued fearlessly,
“She’s a bold, wicked woman, and she seeks
your ruin!”</p>

<p>“How dare you, you insolent creature!” hissed
her ladyship furiously, while the amazed guests
looked in open-mouthed amazement at the demure
little dairymaid so suddenly transformed, standing
with head thrown back and eyes flashing accusingly.</p>

<p>But Robert remained rigidly silent. He would
not be so base, so ungrateful as to shatter his benefactor’s
belief in his wife’s honor, her veracity, he
told himself in a spirit of self-sacrifice. He owed
all he had in the world to him, and he would remain
silent for his sake, and he kept his eyes fixed unresponsively
on the rug at his feet, but the little drops
of perspiration stood out on his brow, as he fought
against the temptation to clear his good name from
ignominy.</p>

<p>Throwing open the door Lady Glencairn pointed
to it dramatically, “There’s the door, Mr. Burns,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
she said insolently; “do not compel me to call my
servants.”</p>

<p>“Jezebel!” muttered Mr. Mackenzie through his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“If he goes I go too,” flashed Mrs. Dunlop, casting
an indignant look at her hostess.</p>

<p>“So will I,” echoed Eppy.</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Mary vibrantly. Her silvery voice
rang out above the confusion, as the guests moved
about among themselves asking all sorts of inane
questions, exploiting their views upon the subject—some
loudly extolling Lady Glencairn’s attitude in
the matter and others as stoutly defending the
bard. Instantly there was an astonished hush.</p>

<p>“My lords and ladies,” continued Mary thrillingly,
“listen to me! I tell ye that Robert Burns is
innocent o’ this contemptible charge laid against him.
I know it, for I was outside the window yonder an’
heard all that passed between him and her ladyship.”</p>

<p>“Spy!” hissed Lady Glencairn between her teeth,
unheard in the hubbub of voices which had commenced
again with Mary’s statement as the subject
of comment, then she laughed mockingly. “How
absurd,” she cried to those about her. “My dear
James, let us end this scene. I will not stay here to
be insulted. Come, my friends, let us retire,” and
she took her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>“Ye shall listen to the truth, all of ye!” cried
Mary resolutely. Clasping and unclasping her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
hands with nervous intensity, her eyes filled with
determined purpose, she faced the fickle crowd that
was regarding her with such open admiration for
her stanchness, her bravery. “I heard her ladyship
swear to ruin Robert because he spurned her
unwomanly offers of love,” she declared, with convincing
earnestness.</p>

<p>A guilty flush reddened the creamy pallor of her
ladyship’s face. “Oh, the shame of it, my lord,
to be thus humiliated before my guests!” she cried,
bursting into nervous tears. “Surely, my lord, you
would not listen to such monstrous tales,” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>“Oh, believe me, I speak the truth,” exclaimed
Mary, a great fear in her heart as she saw the tender
look Lord Glencairn bestowed upon his weeping
wife.</p>

<p>He was torn and spent by conflicting emotions.
He did not doubt his wife, yet the words of the
young girl rang true, and there was only truth
and nobility stamped upon the gloomy face of the
poet. What was he to believe? How could he decide?
His confidence in his wife had never yet been
shaken—yet, stay—there was once when—but he
would not think of that time, it was so long ago,
yet think of it he did with uneasy misgivings. If
she had deceived him once, might she not again? he
asked himself fearfully.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burns, will you assure me on your word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
honor as a man that you are entirely innocent of
any intentional insult to Lady Glencairn?” asked
Mr. Mackenzie bluntly. He had taken his place beside
Robert, along with Mrs. Dunlop and Mary and
Eppy McKay, together with a few more of Robert’s
sympathizers and stanch believers in his innocence.
And now he asked the question in hope of eliciting
some explanation, some excuse, anything, from the
silent man.</p>

<p>Robert raised his head and without looking at
any one particular person, answered simply, indifferently,
as many thought.</p>

<p>“I have always held Lady Glencairn in the highest
respect and admiration,” he said quietly. “She alone
knows what is the end she aims at, by attributing
feelings to me with regard to her which I have
never conceived, and words which I have never uttered.”
And he sank once more into his listless
attitude.</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn passed his hand over his brow in
a bewildered manner. “You were ever truthful,
Robert,” he muttered so low that none but his wife
heard his implied doubt of her.</p>

<p>She turned on him witheringly. “My lord, you
insult me by lending an ear to aught he or his witness
can say in his behalf,” she exclaimed frigidly. Then,
turning to the onlookers, she continued with insolent
innuendo in words and manner, “You all know
the infatuated attachment of this maid for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Burns, who has bewitched her until she is ready to
sacrifice every consideration of truth, reason, or duty
to shield her guilty lover.”</p>

<p>“What a scandal this will cause throughout
Edinburgh,” whispered Eppy to Mrs. Dunlop, who
was almost beside herself with speechless indignation
by this time. She had been listening with growing
anger to Lady Glencairn’s insolent falsehoods, for
she knew they were falsehoods, and she would never
believe that Robbie would belittle himself by lying,
for he was too brutally frank and truthful at times
to be thoroughly an agreeable companion.</p>

<p>Eppy’s inopportune remark was the straw that
broke the camel’s back, and she turned on her hotly.
“Hold your tongue, ye old busy body!” she exploded
violently, nearly knocking the astonished
Eppy down by the suddenness, the unexpectedness,
of the retort.</p>

<p>“I was never so insulted in my life,” Eppy
gasped tearfully, making little dabs at her eyes
with a dainty ’kerchief, and casting hurt, reproachful
glances at the blunt old lady, who, after delivering
her shaft at the unoffending Eppy, turned to
Lord Glencairn, the fire still flashing in her determined
eyes.</p>

<p>“Lord Glencairn,” she said, with a touch of defiance,
“you may forbid me your house hereafter,
and indeed I hardly believe I will be welcome,” with
a look at the scornful face of her hostess; “but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
care not; I believe in Robert’s innocence, and that
Mary Campbell has only spoken the truth.” A few
nodded their heads to each other in approval. Lord
Glencairn stood mute, a prey to the doubting fear
which gripped his heart.</p>

<p>Her ladyship, with one quick look around at the
wavering faces of her friends, knew that she was
losing ground, and the color faded from her cheeks.
A look of nervous fear came into her steely eyes.
She must restore their shaking confidence in her—but
how? It gave her a strange feeling of satisfaction
to know that whatever the outcome, she had
ruined his popularity for the present, but she wanted
to ruin him utterly—to turn every door in Edinburgh
against him. If she could only get someone
to speak in her behalf, she thought prayerfully, as
she looked about her. Suddenly her eyes rested on
the saturnine features of her uncle, who was regarding
her with a malicious smile of triumph. An eager
light came into her hard eyes. He hated Robert
Burns; he would help her out if anyone would; she
would risk it. His word coupled with hers would
instantly turn the tide in her favor. And risking
all upon the throw, she called out loud enough to be
heard above the murmur of voices, “Uncle, it seems
my word is not fully believed,” she said, with a little
pitying, disdainful smile, which brought the flush
of embarrassment to the cheeks of several, who happened
to catch her eye; “so if you will oblige me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
by relating what you know of the unpleasant circumstances,
perhaps your word will be accepted by
our doubting friends.” Her lazy voice was replete
with insulting sarcasm.</p>

<p>All eyes turned to look at Sir William, who, after
one quick, angry glance at the cool, smiling face of
his strategic niece, cleared his throat with irritating
precision, and, without glancing at the startled face
of his victim, who had started to his feet upon hearing
the amazing request of her ladyship, spoke
quickly and harshly, a faint tinge of color dying his
yellow skin as the dastardly lie left his lips.</p>

<p>“I overheard Mr. Burns’ insults to my niece,” he
said firmly. “I was standing behind the curtain
there,” pointing to a large window, “where I had
gone only a moment before Lady Glencairn entered
the room, to glance out of the window, having heard a
noise without, and before I could make my presence
known, Mr. Burns had thrown himself upon his
knees, and—and I did not disturb them,” he concluded
lamely.</p>

<p>“Ye perjurer!” cried Robert furiously. “By
heaven, I could choke ye with your own lie!” and he
turned white with passion. Sir William cowered
back, a look of fear in his shifty eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robbie, take me hame, take me hame,”
gasped Mary, with heart-breaking pathos, and she
sank half fainting in the chair Robert had vacated.</p>

<p>“Come, James, let us retire,” said Lady Glencairn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sweetly, casting a look of grateful triumph at
her uncle. “I am sorry you have lost a friend, but
I could not shield him,” and she pressed his arm with
affected tenderness. Slowly, sorrowfully he allowed
himself to be drawn to the door.</p>

<p>“My lord!” cried Robert hoarsely, “have ye no
word to say to me? Ye have heard the proofs of
my innocence; will ye not believe them?” and his
whole soul was in his eyes as he eagerly searched the
downcast face of his old benefactor.</p>

<p>Lord Glencairn gave him one sad, reproachful
look. “Oh, Robert,” he said brokenly, “and I
trusted you so.”</p>

<p>Robert dropped his hand, which he had extended
pleadingly, and a flush mounted to the roots of his
hair, which quickly faded, leaving him paler than
before, while a look of wounded pride and unutterable
bitterness flashed into his stern face.</p>

<p>“I will attempt no further denial, my lord,” he
said slowly, with quiet dignity. “Calumny has at
last reared its vicious head to strike like some venomous
serpent, seeking to crush me in its enveloping
folds. The genius of the Bard is ignored, forgotten—only
my obscure birth, my sins, my indiscretions,
my faults are remembered now,” and he smiled
with mournful bitterness.</p>

<p>“Ye have been too puffed up with pride and
vanity,” cried Sir William brutally. “Edinburgh
has tired of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert gave a scornful little laugh. “Why,” he
asked, looking around at those who had been only
too glad to fawn upon him a few moments before,
“because I am no longer a curiosity for the vulgar
to gaze at?” He spoke with biting sarcasm. He
paused a minute, then continued bitterly. “Oh, fool
that I have been! At last my eyes are opened to my
true position in your world of society. How I hate
and despise the hypocrisy of you so-called some-bodies!
How you fawn and smirk and bow down
to wealth and position, while the man of genius, of
avowed worth is disbelieved, dishonored, and insulted!
God, the humiliation of it all!” His eyes
flashed with righteous anger and the indignant scorn
in his voice cut deeply through the thin skin of
more than one of his listeners. “I have endured
the insults heaped upon my head to-day in bitterness
of spirit and in silent scorn,” he continued stormily,
“but noo my outraged manhood at last rebels, and I
throw down my gage of contemptuous defiance.”</p>

<p>“Robert, calm yourself, laddie!” whispered Mrs.
Dunlop apprehensively, laying a restraining hand
upon his arm, which trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>“Your friends will never believe aught against
you, Mr. Burns,” exclaimed Mr. Mackenzie, with
deep feeling in his voice.</p>

<p>“My friends!” repeated Robert wildly. “I have
none, I want none in this purse proud city. No
longer will I submit to insulting condescension. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
longer will I skulk into a corner of the street like
the veriest nobody on earth, lest the rattling equipage
of some gossiping titled blockhead mangle me
in the mire.”</p>

<p>“Robert, I have always loved you,” exclaimed
Lord Glencairn, with rebuking reproachfulness.</p>

<p>“But ye believe the worst of me noo,” replied
Robert passionately. “It only needed this scene
of scandal to show my friends in their true colors.”</p>

<p>“Then go back to your low-born friends where
ye belong,” snarled Sir William vindictively.</p>

<p>“I mean to go back,” retorted Robert, his face
flushing crimson, “and with gladness will I shake
the dust of this unjust city off my feet.” A softer
look came over his haggard face and his eyes filled
with a yearning look of utter heart-weariness, a sudden
longing for the blissful quiet of his country
home. A tender sweetness came into his voice as
he continued softly, “I will return from whence
I came, to the plowtail, where the poetic genius of
my country found me and threw her inspiring mantle
over me.”</p>

<p>Mary took his hand in hers, and with infinite tenderness
murmured fondly, “An’ ye’ll find the banks
an’ braes of bonnie Doon holding out their arms to
welcome ye back to your native heath once more,
laddie.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope he’ll shine to better advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
there,” sneered Sir William. A nervous little titter
broke the tense silence.</p>

<p>Robert turned on him, goaded to sudden fury.
“Ye bird o’ ill omen!” he panted hoarsely, “I have
never injured ye; I have brought money into your
empty pockets. But ye will repent bitterly for
swearing away my life as ye have this day, for e’en
though I leave Edinburgh in shame and disgrace,
’tis not for ay. Nay! I thank God my works will
live after me, that my name will yet become immortal.”
His words rang out wildly and with impassioned
intensity.</p>

<p>Lady Glencairn laughed mockingly, and, turning
to some of her friends standing near, she made some
low-toned remark, evidently a sarcastic witticism at
the expense of the speaker, which elicited a burst of
hollow laughter from her listeners, who, while they
wished to remain in the favor of the leader of Edinburgh
society, stood in wholesome awe of the blunt
speech, the scornful wit of the brilliant poet on
trial before them.</p>

<p>“Ye vain boaster!” scoffed Sir William loudly,
“you’ll be forgot within a week,” and he laughed
derisively.</p>

<p>“Ye may scoff, ye may laugh,” retorted Robert
hotly. “Ye may call me egoist if ye like, but I know
what I have done for my country—I have attuned
my wild artless notes to sing her praises, joys, and
sorrows, and I know those songs will live forever in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the heart of every true Scotsman.” Suddenly, like
a ray of sunshine which dispels the morning mist,
his dark haughty face took upon itself a noble,
thoughtful, rapt expression—his wildly flashing eyes
softened—his furrowed brow smoothed, and, fixing
his luminous eyes upon the disdainful face of his
hostess, he continued with melancholy pathos and
prophetic solemnity, “Ah, my lady, ye have
trampled my good name low in the dust to-day, but
my prophetic spirit tells me the day is coming, even
though ye an’ all my traducers here be dead, rotted
and forgot, when one name will be remembered, cherished
and proclaimed above all others of Scotland,
aye, the world, and that name, my lords and ladies,
will not be of any rich titled somebody! Nay, ’twill
be that of the plowman-poet of Ayrshire, Robert
Burns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p>The situation in which Robert now found himself
was calculated to awaken reflection. The time had
come, so he gloomily told his friend, Will Nichol, the
morning after the garden party at Lord Glencairn’s,
for him to abandon the gayety and dissipation
of which he had been too much enamored; and
all that day he pondered seriously, if gloomily, on
the past, and formed virtuous resolutions respecting
the future. He had weeks ago made up his mind
to settle himself for life in the occupation of agriculture,
and now that Edinburgh had tired of his
peculiarities, and the novelty of his appearance had
become an old story for them, there was nothing
left for him to do but to start in on his new life as
soon as possible. To further that end he called upon
Sir William that day and demanded a settlement.
When he left the office he found himself master of
nearly £500. With the money in his pocket he
again called on Will Nichols and requested him to
assist him in the selection of a farm. With his
advice and assistance he soon decided to lease the
farm of Ellisland, on the banks of the River Nith,
just above Dumfries. When he had in this manner
arranged his plans for the future his generous heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which was sore and bleeding from the many wounds
it had recently received, wounds which seemed to the
suffering man that would never heal in this life,
turned in pity and remorse to the mother of his child—a
thrill of yearning stirred him strangely as he
thought of the little one—his son—a warm feeling
of love welled up in his heart as he softly repeated
the words; and listening to no consideration but
those of honor and duty, and a strange feeling of
growing affection, which made him pause in wonder,
he sought out Jean at the Inn, having learned that
she was still in town, contrary to Lady Glencairn’s
assertion, which he had believed; and there, with his
friends surrounding them, they were joined in a
public declaration of marriage, thus legalizing their
union and rendering it permanent for life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop and Mary had not been present at
the ceremony. Mary was confined to her bed in a
state of nervous collapse, and Mrs. Dunlop, much
as she loved Robert, and honored him for the noble
step he was taking, could not leave the stricken girl.
It was her wish and determination to keep Mary with
her as long as she could content herself there. Her
kind, motherly heart ached in silent sympathy for
the child who had received such a bitter disappointment,
and who was bearing her sorrows with such
patient fortitude. Before Robert left the city she
wrote for him to come and see her, assuring him of
her continued friendship, etc., etc. That evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
found him seated beside his stanch friend in whom
he confided his hopes and his fears for the future,
and soon he had poured out the bitterness of his
heart, the yearnings of his soul, all the cruel disappointments
of his tempestuous life. She listened in
sympathetic silence, a smile of encouragement, every
now and then, lighting up her face. When he had
finished, she told him how proud she was of him, how
she gloried in his strength of purpose, his new-made
resolutions, cautioned him not to forget the new
vows he had so lately formed, warned him of the
many vices, the back-sliding state into which one of
his temperament was so apt to fall. Then with infinite
tenderness she told him of the courage of the
sweet maiden who now lay upon her bed of sorrow
in the upper room, told him of her loyalty, her pride
in his greatness, in his nobility, while he listened with
the burning tears streaming unchecked down his
quivering cheeks. After a pause she took him by
the hand and led him softly to the door of Mary’s
chamber. “For the last farewell,” she whispered
sadly. Then she left him standing before the door,
gazing at it as though it were the gates of Heaven
which were about to open for him at his bidding. A
sweet voice bade him enter, in answer to his timid
knock, and softly opening the door, he stepped into
the room.</p>

<p>Mary opened her beautiful, tired blue eyes, thinking
it was her dear benefactress, and then what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
divine rapture—what a dazzling wonder and joy
flashed into them, giving them back their old luster
of sunlight sparkling on an azure sea. She sprang
up in her bed and stretched out her arms.</p>

<p>“Robert!” she cried sobbingly. “Oh, Robbie,
my darling.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop came back and softly closed the door
on the sacred stillness that followed. Then she
slowly wended her way down to her sitting-room and
sat down with a deep sigh. “What a sad old world
this is,” she thought. The time dragged along very
slowly as she patiently waited for Robert to come
down. Presently she heard the door above close
ever so gently, and then his low footfall down the
thick stair carpet. She rose and met him in the reception
hall. He stood on the lowest step, his hand on
the balustrade, his breast heaving with the strain of
his emotions. Mrs. Dunlop took his hand tenderly
and pressed it in loving sympathy.</p>

<p>By and by he spoke, and the intense suffering in
his voice touched her keenly. “As ye sow, so shall
ye reap,” he muttered brokenly. She could only
press his hand in silent sympathy. Gradually his
grief became quiet and a look of melancholy resignation
came over his expressive face.</p>

<p>“When will you leave the city?” she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>He thought a moment. “My affairs will be settled
by the week’s end,” he replied, “then I shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
straight to Ellisland. I——” He paused a moment,
then straightened himself, and continued in a
firm voice, “Jean has gone to Mauchline. She will
remain there until the house at Ellisland is in condition
to receive her.” He held out his hand.
“And now, dear, good friend, good-by.”</p>

<p>“No, not good-by, laddie,” she answered tearfully.
“Just <i>au revoir</i>, for I mean to visit you some
day,” and she smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>With a last shake of the hand, he left her, while
above stairs a sweet, wan, tear-stained face, pressed
close against the pane, watched his bowed figure
striding moodily toward his lodging, watched it as
it faded, growing dimmer and dimmer, till it was lost
to sight.</p>

<p>When Robert reached Ellisland the evening sun
was flaming over the distant western hills. Not a
breath stirred the crimson opening blossom, or the
verdant spreading leaf. It was a golden moment
for a poet’s heart. He stopped his horse by the door
of the cottage and stood silently regarding his
future home. He had secured from Mr. Miller in
Dumfries, the owner of the farm, the keys, and declining
the company of several, who offered to show
him the way to his new possession, he set out on his
journey in gloomy solitude. For a few moments he
listened to the birds pouring their harmony on
every hand, as if to welcome the wanderer, then
with a sigh he unlocked the door and went
within. A few weeks passed uneventfully. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
his arrival he had immediately begun to rebuild the
dwelling house, which was inadequate to accommodate
his family. It afforded his jaded senses much
pleasure to survey the grounds he was about to cultivate,
and in rearing a building that should give
shelter to his wife and children (who were with Squire
Armour in Mauchline, the stern old man having
relented upon a bed of sickness), and, as he
fondly hoped, to his own gray hairs; sentiments of
independence buoyed up his mind; pictures of domestic
content and peace rose in his imagination;
and a few weeks passed away, the most tranquil, if
not the happiest, which he had experienced for some
time. His fame naturally drew upon him the attention
of his neighbors in the district in which he lived,
and he was received at the table of the gentlemen of
Nithdale with welcome, with kindness and respect.
It is to be lamented that at this critical period of his
life he was without the restraining influences of the
society of his wife, for a great change had
taken place in his situation; his old habits were
broken, and he brooded in melancholy abstraction
upon his past glories in Edinburgh and his wrongs,
while thoughts of Highland Mary constantly filled
his waking hours, and caused him to forget the good
resolutions he had formed, in his desire to drown
recollections. The social parties to which he was
invited too often seduced him from his rustic labor
and his plain rustic food, and overthrew the unsteady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
fabric of his resolutions, inflaming those propensities
which temperance might have weakened, and
prudence finally suppressed. It was not long, therefore,
before Robert began to view his farm with dislike
and despondence, if not with disgust. Before his
advent into Edinburgh society, and during his sojourn
there, he had refrained from the habitual use
of strong liquors. But in Dumfries the sins that so
easily beset him continually presented themselves,
and though he clearly foresaw the consequences of
yielding to them, his appetite and sensations, which
could not prevent the dictates of his judgment,
finally triumphed over the power of his will.</p>

<p>His great celebrity made him an object of interest
and curiosity to strangers, and few persons of cultivated
minds passed through Dumfries without attempting
to see the poet, and to enjoy the pleasure
of his conversation. As he could not receive them
under his own humble roof these interviews passed
at the inns of the towns, and often terminated in
excesses, which Robert was seldom able to resist.
Indeed, there were never wanting persons to share
his social pleasures, to lead or accompany him to the
tavern, to partake in the wildest sallies of his wit, or
to witness the strength and degradation of his genius.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he had for several years looked to
an office in the excise as a certain means of livelihood,
should his other expectations fail. He had been
recommended to the Board of Excise before leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Mossgiel, and had received the instructions necessary
for such a situation. He now applied to be
employed regularly, and was immediately appointed
exciseman, or gauger, as it is vulgarly called, of the
district in which he lived. His farm was after this,
in a great measure, abandoned to servants, while he
betook himself to the duties of his new appointment.
To be sure he could still be seen at intervals directing
his plow, a labor in which he excelled, but it was
not at Ellisland that he was now in general to be
found. Mounted on horseback, our hero was pursuing
the defaulters of the revenue among the hills
and vales of Nithdale, his roving eye wandering over
the charms of nature, and muttering his wayward
fancies as he moved along. Though by nature of an
athletic form, Robert had in his constitution the
peculiarities and delicacies that belong to the
temperament of genius. Endowed by nature with
great sensibility of nerves, he was in his corporeal,
as well as in his mental system, liable to inordinate
impressions, to fever of the body, as well as of mind.
This predisposition to disease, which strict temperance
in diet, regular exercise, and sound sleep might
have subdued, habits of a very different nature,
strengthened and inflamed.</p>

<p>The following year Jean and her bairns came to
live at Ellisland. He received them with quiet affection,
and Jean, who had grown strangely humbled
and passive, did her utmost to please him at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
times, never referring to the past, and tactfully
avoiding all irritating subjects, and by her soothing
presence, her loving words of comfort and sympathy,
soon made her presence indispensable to her
moody husband. Another year passed by, a year
of anxiety for Jean, who was compelled to witness
her husband’s lapses from sobriety, which now came
so often, and to watch his health decline slowly, but
surely, in consequence. In the midst of all his wanderings
Robert met nothing in his domestic circle
but gentleness and forgiveness, except the gnawings
of his own remorse. He acknowledged his transgressions
to his patient wife, promised amendment, and
again received pardon for his offenses. But as the
strength of his body decayed, his resolution became
feebler, and habit acquired predominating strength.</p>

<p>All this time Robert had entertained hopes of promotion
in the exercise, but circumstances occurred
which retarded their fulfillment, and which in his own
mind destroyed all expectation of their ever being
fulfilled. His steady friend, Mr. Mackenzie, interposed
his good offices in his behalf, however, and he
was suffered to retain his situation, but given to
understand that his promotion was deferred, and
must depend on his future behavior. This circumstance
made a deep impression on Robert. He
fancied that everyone held him in contemptuous pity,
as a man of some genius who had dwindled into a
paltry exciseman, and who was slinking out the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of his insignificant existence in the meanest of pursuits,
and among the lowest of mankind; and for
days he would sit quietly on the banks of the river
plunged in the gloomiest meditation.</p>

<p>About this time he received word of Lord Glencairn’s
death. The news plunged him into another
fit of melancholy gloom, lessened somewhat, however,
by the assurance that his noble benefactor had died
knowing the truth, believing in Robert’s innocence,
and asking his forgiveness.</p>

<p>As his health declined his thoughts became more
and more fixed upon Mary, who was once more in
Mossgiel at Colonel Montgomery’s. He yearned
with bitter longing to gaze upon her sweet face again,
to hear her dear voice speak his name. These thoughts
he strove vainly to conquer, to banish from his mind,
for Jean’s patience and goodness, her loving forbearance,
filled him with shame at his own unworthiness.
But she gave no sign of the bitter heartache
she endured. She accepted it all in patient resignation,
striving by uniform prudence and good management
to relieve his distress of mind regarding
the material welfare of his little flock.</p>

<p>Toward the end of spring he contracted a severe
cold while in reckless pursuit of an offender, in a
driving rain storm, and, having caught the guilty
one, he celebrated the event at the inn, in company
with some congenial spirits, seated in his wet clothes,
the result being an attack of rheumatism, which laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
him upon a bed of sickness for some weeks. His
salary was but a small one, hardly sufficient to keep
his family from want, and though hitherto his farm
had yielded him a comfortable living, for some
months it had been left to run itself, with the inevitable
results. Planting time had come and gone, and
still his ground lay all untouched. His laborers had
refused to work for him longer without pay, and
Souter Johnny, who was now making his home at
Ellisland, could only attend to the lighter chores
about the farm. And now things began to take a
serious outlook for our hero and his family. Though
sick and discouraged, with want staring him in the
face, he still sent glowing reports of his continued
prosperity to his loved ones in Mossgiel, reports that
filled their anxious hearts with false hopes and prayerful
thankfulness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<p>One day during Robert’s early convalescence,
Souter, after having finished his chores, sauntered
leisurely through the vegetable garden. It was a
peaceful nook, and there were household odors of
mint, and thyme, and boy’s love, which were pleasant
to the soul of Souter Johnny, and reminded him of
stewed rabbit, which he dearly loved, with all its
attendant delicacies. He paced the path slowly, the
light of the sinking sun blazing gloriously upon the
brilliant gown of his companion, who was simpering
along beside him, her little gray eyes looking down
on him with flattering interest as she listened with
apparent delight to his tales of daring adventure.
Finally their conversation drifted to the sick man
within.</p>

<p>“Poor bonnie laddie,” sighed Eppy dolefully.
“To think of him being so ill. We all loved him
dearly in Edinburgh.”</p>

<p>“He hasna’ been the same lad since he returned
from there,” replied Souter. “He had many great
disappointments in his young life, I tell ye,” and he
shook his head dismally. “An’ noo everything has
gone to the dogs wi’ him, ever since he has been
in Ellisland. ’Twas a sorry day when he became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
exciseman, say I.” He paused a moment reflectively,
then continued earnestly, “But no matter
what anybody says different, he has always done his
duty faithfully, always on the tramp in all kinds of
weather, till at last his robust constitution has given
out, an’ he bowled over, so to speak.” He loyally
refrained from mentioning that Robert’s illness was
partly due to his imprudent way of living.</p>

<p>Eppy sighed again. “And he the Bard of Scotland,”
she returned commiseratingly. “How I pity
him. Isn’t it sad Mr. MacDougall?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” replied Souter, with a quick look from
under his shaggy eyebrows. “Ye hae a kind heart
in ye, Miss McKay,” he observed after a pause.</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” she simpered. “I
fear you are a base flatterer, Mr. MacDougall. In
Edinburgh there were so many who flattered me, who
sought for my favors, that I became wearied of it
all, and longed for a change. That is why I came
here to Ayrshire and purchased the farm adjoining,
that I might rest during the summer.”</p>

<p>“And then ye’ll be leaving us?” asked Souter
with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” and she looked at him coquettishly.
“Would anyone care if I did return to
town?” she insinuated slyly.</p>

<p>“’Tis a wonder that such a bonnie lassie as ye
should still be a maiden,” he observed abruptly with
a sly look out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I have had many offers,” she answered airily,
though her heart fluttered with a newly-born
hope.</p>

<p>“Do ye ne’er get lonely, Miss McKay?”</p>

<p>She sighed and cast down her eyes. “Yes, I do,”
she declared plaintively, “and I’m lonely now in that
great big house with only a servant for company.”</p>

<p>“Souter Johnny,” said Souter to himself, “this
is the chance of your lifetime; go in and win a home.”
Having arrived at this resolution, he cleared his
throat and pausing in his walk, faced the simpering
old lady. “Mum, ye see before ye,” he remarked,
not without some nervousness, “a single man, like
yoursel’. Not from necessity, och nae; Souter
Johnny, before he lost his handsome looks, could hae
had his pick o’ any o’ the lassies, but I hae waited
till noo——” he paused impressively.</p>

<p>“Till now, Mr. MacDougall?” she repeated
breathlessly, eager to have him continue.</p>

<p>“Weel, noo I hae found her,” he answered, “an’
she’s what I hae been lookin’ for a’ my life.”</p>

<p>“How romantic you are,” she cried soulfully, with
an admiring look.</p>

<p>“Aye, that I am, ’tis born in me,” he responded.
“Do ye mind if I smoke, mum?” he asked carelessly.
He took out of his waistcoat pocket his old black
pipe and held it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she gushed. “I love to see you smoke,
’tis so manly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Having lighted his pipe and got it drawing to his
satisfaction, he turned to her once more, and remarked
casually, “Would ye call me too old to get
married? I’m askin’ your advice noo.” He looked
at her quizzically.</p>

<p>She shook her head vigorously in the negative.
“Age does not matter at all,” she observed sagely.
“The question is do you feel peart?” and she regarded
him with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>A grim smile played around Souter’s lips. Removing
his pipe, he replied with convincing firmness,
“Never was sick in my life, strong and healthy.
Feel my muscle!” and he held out his doubled arm
to the timid Eppy, who shrank away bashfully. “It
willna’ hurt ye,” he declared. Thus encouraged, she
gingerly touched it with one finger. “Fine, isn’t
it?” he asked proudly. Before she could answer
he continued, “I have a fine appetite, mum, an’ I
dinna’ feel my age. Noo I ask ye, am I too ugly to
be looked at, mum? Dinna’ be afraid to tell me the
truth.” He held up his head, straightened his bent
shoulders and stood awaiting her reply.</p>

<p>She eyed him a moment in silence. “Well, Mr.
MacDougall,” she said doubtfully, after a pause, “I
must confess you’re no beauty.” A look of disappointment
came over Souter’s face, seeing which
she hastened to reassure him. “But I care not for
looks, Mr. MacDougall,” she cried earnestly. “One
could get used to you. I’ve heard it said that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
can get used to anything in time,” and she smiled
sweetly into his downcast face.</p>

<p>He gave her a quick look.</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?” he returned reflectively.
“Weel, looks is all a matter of taste. And noo let’s
get down to business.” Eppy gave a start and her
hands fluttered about nervously, as she waited for
his next words. “Do ye think, mum, this sweet,
lovely lassie I hae in my mind would hae me for a
husband?” he insinuated softly.</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp. “This is so sudden,” she
simpered, then broke off abruptly—he hadn’t asked
her yet. “Er—why don’t you ask the beautiful lassie.
She might think of it.” She coyly looked down
upon him from under her big bonnet.</p>

<p>Souter threw down his pipe in his earnestness. “I
will,” he ejaculated quickly, his eyes sparkling with
triumph. “’Tis your ain bright sel’ for whom my
heart is yearnin’. Will ye hae me, Eppy?”</p>

<p>Eppy closed her eyes in blissful content. “My
first proposal,” she thought joyfully. Opening her
eyes, she gazed at him fondly. “Oh, I don’t want to
make a mistake now,” she cried, half frightened, but
she had no intention of refusing him, however.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ fear,” replied Souter eagerly. “I’ll
attend to that; there’ll be no mistake made, I’ll warrant
ye.”</p>

<p>“You’re such a masterful man,” she exclaimed,
with an admiring look, “and—well, there’s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
gainsaying you. I must confess a real live man
about the house would be most comforting—to my
sister, Sibella—and—and me, so I—I’ll have you,
Souter,” and she threw herself into his arms with a
cry of joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, thank ye, mum,” said Souter gratefully.
“I feel as if I had won the prize ticket in a
grand lottery.” He heaved a great sigh of blissful
content as he thought of the big house across
the way. “There noo, my pipe is out again,” he
observed, after a little pause, and he calmly turned
his back and proceeded to relight it, leaving Eppy
regarding him with reproachful eyes and pouting
lips.</p>

<p>“Souter,” she finally faltered, “I—I thought
you were more romantic. We haven’t sealed our
engagement by a—a——”</p>

<p>“A—what?” asked Souter concernedly. “Is
there something mair to do?”</p>

<p>She sidled up to him, giggling bashfully, and after
turning to see if they were observed, she put her arm
around his neck and said pensively:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gin a body meet a body comin’ thro’ the rye,</div>
<div class="verse">Gin a body kiss a body, need a body cry.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A comical look of comprehension dawned on
Souter’s face. “O—oh! I see, ’tis a kiss ye mean,”
he answered lightly. “Weel, noo, I’ll na’ stop ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
if ye want to kiss me. If you can stand it, I can,”
and he held his face up to hers, for she towered a
foot above him. With a sudden dart, a downward
sweep of her head, she glued her lips to the little
man’s, then with a resounding smack she released
him, with a sigh of absolute content upon her homely
face. “Weel, noo, that’s not half bad,” observed
Souter, smacking his lips reflectively.</p>

<p>“Now, Souter,” declared Eppy decidedly, after
they had walked a few paces in quiet, “since you
are a Highlander, you must wear the kilt, to please
me; and it must be the tartan of our clan.”</p>

<p>Souter threw up his hands in amazed horror.
“Oh, dearie, dinna’ ask me to do that; I canna’ wear
the kilt; I am na’ built that way,” and he looked
down at his legs with whimsical seriousness.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll not marry you,” she declared with
apparent firmness.</p>

<p>Souter hurriedly explained in trembling fear.
“I’ll tell ye the truth, dearie: when I last wore the
kilt the laddies laughed at my crooked legs an’
called me a scarecrow, an’ I swore then I’d ne’er
show my bare legs to mortal man again. Would ye
hae me expose my miserable defects, womman?”</p>

<p>She stood off and let her eyes rove slowly down
his nether extremities with the air of a connoisseur.
“I protest they do not look so badly,” she observed
encouragingly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘Keep on turning,’ she commanded.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Looks are deceivin’, lassie,” quickly replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Souter, who objected seriously to kilts. “My legs
are na’ my beauty point, for a’ that; they are just
twa wee bones, I tell ye, so be prepared for the
worst,” and he shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as Mr. Burns says, ‘A man’s a man,
for a’ that!’” she replied sweetly. Then after a
moment’s reflection, she asked with tender solicitude,
“Are they so very wee, Souter?”</p>

<p>“Aye, ye should see them,” he replied eagerly,
hoping to convince her as to his unfitness to wear
the dress.</p>

<p>Eppy held up her hands before her face in horror.
“Whatever are you saying, Souter?”</p>

<p>“Weel, my legs are a maist sensitive subject wi’
me, my dear,” he returned apologetically.</p>

<p>“Turn around,” she commanded. He did so in
wonder. “Keep on turning,” she commanded. “I
think, mayhap, they’re not so bad,” she observed
after a critical inspection. “However, after we are
wed I can decide better whether ye can wear the kilt
or not.”</p>

<p>Souter regarded her in meek astonishment, then
he humbly rejoined, “Weel, if ye can stand their
looks, I’ll na’ complain, but it’s o’er chilly at times,”
and he shivered apprehensively.</p>

<p>She laughed gayly. “Now, Souter, I must go
home. Come over soon, you masterful man!”</p>

<p>“Aye, the first thing in the morning,” retorted
Souter calmly, “an’ I’ll bring the minister wi’ me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“The minister! Why bring him?” asked Eppy in
amazement.</p>

<p>“To marry us, my dear,” replied Souter quietly.</p>

<p>“You must be daft man!” she cried in sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>Souter shook his head. “Ye’d better take no
chances,” he retorted calmly. “I may change my
mind,” and he carefully knocked the ashes out of his
pipe and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“You impatient man!” fluttered Eppy. “I—I—come
over and we’ll talk about it. Good-by,
laddie,” and she tripped daintily off down the path
toward the gate.</p>

<p>Then Souter sat down on the seat under the big
tree beside the house. “Souter Johnny,” he said to
himself, “ye’re a devil with the wimmen, mon,” and
a smile of self-satisfaction stole over his wrinkled
face.</p>

<p>“Souter Johnny!” panted Eppy, running back
to him breathlessly, “I’ve changed my mind.”</p>

<p>Souter jumped to his feet in sudden terror. Had
he lost her after all, or rather, had he lost the home
across the way? “W—what, do you mean?” he
stammered.</p>

<p>“I mean—you—you—may bring the minister,”
she gasped, and away she fluttered down the walk
before he could recover from his astonishment.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! your fortune is made, Souter Johnny!”
he cried aloud, when the meaning of her words had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
dawned upon him, and he threw his bonnet high in
the air. “Ye’ll nae hae to cobble shoes any mair,
noo, for ye’ll be lord of the manor house, wi’ servants
to wait on ye. Oh, the power of money! ye’ll
ride out in your fine carriage, Souter, and as ye
drive by, all the neighbors will be bowing and scraping
to ye. I can see them noo. ’Twill be ‘Mr. MacDougall,
will ye do us the honor to call at the castle;
her ladyship would be pleased to see you.’ Then I’ll
say to them that snubbed me when I was poor, ‘Weel,
noo, ’tis very busy I am, attending to my estates and
other social duties. Tell her grace that Mr. and
Mrs. MacDougall will be pleased to have her visit
us at MacDougall House, if she cares to meet us.’”
And he stalked along majestically to the house with
his head held proudly erect. “Noo, I’ll find the
minister and make sure of my bird.” Arriving at
the door of the cottage, he stopped, and addressing
an imaginary butler, said pompously, “James, open
the door, your master wishes to enter! Thank ye!
Noo take my hat! Noo ye may go!” With a
chuckle of delight he quietly opened the door and
composing his features into their natural expression,
entered the cottage and made his way to the kitchen,
where he found a bowl of porridge awaiting him,
which he hungrily devoured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the other room Robert lay tossing
feverishly upon his bed. Jean sat beside him
smoothing his pillow from time to time, and soothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
his anguished mind with words of love and
encouragement.</p>

<p>“Blessings on your faithful head, Jean,” he murmured
gratefully. “You’re the best, truest wife that
erring mortal man ever had.” She flushed with
pleasure at his words of praise. “Oh, this accursed
rheumatism,” he groaned. “How it shackles one,
making one as much a prisoner as though a ball
and chain were attached to his ankle.”</p>

<p>“But you are much better to-day,” said Jean
brightly.</p>

<p>“For a while only. I fear me this is my fatal
illness,” he replied despondently.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Robert; you’ll be on your feet
in a few days now,” and she looked hopefully into his
worn and haggard face.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand gently. “I haven’t been
the best of husbands, lass,” he said after a pause.
“I have sore tried your patience and your love
ofttimes, by my unfaithfulness, my unworthiness.”</p>

<p>“I do not complain, Robert,” she answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“No, ye have never done that,” he said with a
tender smile, “frequent though my lapses in sobriety
and propriety have been.” He paused
thoughtfully; presently he continued in mournful reflection,
“But I was punished for those sins afterward,
for then came remorse, shame, regret, the three
hell hounds that ever dog my steps and bay at my
heels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it is God’s will——” began Jean, but he
interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, Jean,” he replied bitterly. “’Tis not
God’s will that I should be here, racked with pain
and tortured by the sins that come staring me in the
face, each one telling a more bitter tale than his
fellow. ’Tis only the result of my own headstrong
folly.” She wiped away the drops of perspiration
from his brow with tender fingers, while he lay panting
from the excitement that the recital of his sorrows
had occasioned.</p>

<p>“There, do not distress yourself with such bitter
thoughts,” she told him gently. “What is done, is
done, and all our sins will be blotted out in that
other life.”</p>

<p>“That other life,” he repeated dreamily. “Can
it be possible that when I resign this feverish being
I shall find myself in conscious existence, enjoying
and enjoyed? Would to God I as firmly believed it
as I ardently wish it. If there is another life,” he
continued with a flash of his old whimsical brightness,
“it must be for the just, the benevolent, the
amiable only, and the good. I’m sore afraid Rob
Burns will na’ be able to get even a peep through
the Pearly Gates.”</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” replied Jean with tender reproach.
“’Twill be open to all. ‘Let whosoever will, come
and have eternal life,’ the Master said.”</p>

<p>He mused a while on that sweet thought. “Ah,
weel, just noo,” he returned with a sigh, “this life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
is what we must face, and which I must cling to as
long as I can for the sake of my little flock. Poverty
and misfortune must be overcome, and at once.
Our salvation now lies in my getting the supervisorship
and increased salary; then we need have no fear
of the future; we can laugh at fate.”</p>

<p>“You sent your last poem, ‘Prettiest maid on
Devon’s bank,’ to Mr. Thompson, didn’t ye, laddie?”
asked Jean anxiously.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he replied, closing his eyes wearily.
“And I implored him for God’s sake to send me
a few pounds to tide me over the present, till I got
my promotion. I am not asking a loan, ’tis a
business transaction,” he continued proudly, “and
I ken he will send whatever he is able to spare.
He is a good friend, and it grieves me bitterly to
be obliged to ask help of him to keep us from starving.
But,” and a note of independence crept into
his voice, “my song is worth whatever he sends.”</p>

<p>“Hunger and want can humble the most independent
spirit,” returned Jean sadly. She rose and
walked to the window and looked out into the twilight
with searching, anxious eyes. “Posty should
bring us an answer to-night,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“An’ he will,” cried Robert hopefully, “for
Thompson willna’ disappoint me, for he kens I am
in sore straits.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless him!” cried Jean fervently.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p>The next day our hero was in better health and
spirits, and insisted upon being up and dressed.
Jean, not without secret misgivings, got him into
his clothes and helped him to the rocking-chair,
which she had drawn up to the open window. For
a while he sat there in silent content, bathed in the
warm, golden light of the morning sun, whose genial
beams seemed to infuse new vigor into his languid
frame, while the gentle summer wind blew upon him
with its exhilarating, refreshing warmth. After Jean
had performed her household duties she returned to
find him playing happily with their two boys, telling
them tale after tale, while they sat perched on
either arm of the big rocker, their eyes popping out
of their round, healthy faces with excited interest.
He looked up as she entered and smiled into her
anxious face.</p>

<p>“Do not tire yourself, Robert,” she cautioned him
gently. “Come, lads, run out doors and play a wee,
your father is tired.” But they clung to him
affectionately.</p>

<p>“One mair story,” they pleaded.</p>

<p>“Tell us aboot Tam O’Shanter’s ride!” commanded
Robert, Jr., gravely. Jean sat down while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he recited the stirring tale, and watched her husband
with eyes aglow with love and pity. How changed
he was, she thought with a sigh. What havoc had
been wrought in that sturdy frame, that fine constitution,
in the once ringing tones of his musical
voice. Alas, all had flown, but with God’s help she
would win him back to health and strength once
more, she told herself with resolute determination.
As he finished he kissed the earnest faces held up to
his with such worshipful affection, and with a serious
“Thank ye, father,” they turned and marched quietly
out of the room and into the open air, and soon their
childish treble floated in through the open window,
bringing a smile of amused affection to the faces
of their parents.</p>

<p>“Now, Robert, ye must be tired out,” remarked
Jean presently. “Will ye not try and get a
nappie?”</p>

<p>“In a wee, Jean,” he answered, looking out of the
window thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Then you must have a bittie of gruel now,”
she said, rising and going toward the door.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Jean, I thank ye, but I canna’ eat nor
drink nor sleep just at present.”</p>

<p>“Then try and take a nappie,” she insisted,
smoothing the pillows and sheets in anxious preparation.</p>

<p>“A little later, Jean,” he replied a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>She sighed patiently. “Then I’ll leave ye for
a while,” and she walked toward the door. “Ye’re
quite comfortable?” she asked. He nodded. Slowly
she closed the door upon him and applied herself to
the task of getting the midday meal.</p>

<p>Presently, a knock on the door startled her, interrupting
her meager preparations. Hastily wiping
her hands on her apron, she opened it, and there on
the threshold stood two richly dressed strangers.
“From the city,” she mentally said, noticing the
elegance of their attire.</p>

<p>Courteously raising his high conical blue silk hat,
the younger man addressed her. “Is not this Mistress
Burns, whom I have the honor to address?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I am Mistress Burns,” replied Jean with dignity.</p>

<p>“We have come to see your husband. Will you
inform him, my dear madam, that his friend Henry
Mackenzie would be pleased to converse with him.”</p>

<p>Jean opened wide the door, a look of pleasure on
her face. “Please to enter,” she said quietly. They
did so. She showed them into the living-room and
bade them be seated. “Robert will be out directly,”
she said, and hastily went to tell Robert of their
arrival.</p>

<p>“So this is where Scotland’s Bard lives,” remarked
Mr. Mackenzie, looking about the room critically.
“This cheerless hut, which bespeaks naught but
poverty. Poor Burns, I pity him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis all his own fault,” testily replied his companion.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that, Sir William,” said Mr.
Mackenzie with a swift look at him. “I have always
believed and maintained that Burns was innocent of
that monstrous charge my Lady Glencairn brought
against him, even though you did confess to being an
eye witness of the occurrence. However, she has received
her just deserts. She is at last totally
ostracized.”</p>

<p>“Do ye mean to say——” sputtered Sir William.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie raised his hand in a stately gesture.
“I really do not care to discuss it, Sir
William. But at last Edinburgh is beginning to
realize how cruelly they have misjudged him, and
they would welcome him back again, but I fear his
pride and independence will prevent his accepting
any assistance whatever.”</p>

<p>Sir William gave a snort of impatience. “I
cannot waste my sympathy on him,” he said angrily.
“I am dispatched here to do my duty, and I must
do it,” and his mouth set in a straight, determined
line.</p>

<p>“’Tis a duty that for once is uncommon pleasant
to you,” replied Mackenzie sarcastically. There
was silence for a moment, then he continued, “I
take it, the decision of the Board is final?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis irrevocable, sir,” replied Sir William
gruffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he must live on here as a poor exciseman,”
murmured Mackenzie half to himself. “Live! In
sooth ’tis but an existence,” and he strode to the
window in sudden perturbation and gazed thoughtfully
out upon the untilled land.</p>

<p>The door of the chamber opened and Robert
entered the room, a smile of pleasure lighting up
his face. Mr. Mackenzie stepped eagerly forward
and clasped his hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>“I am uncommon glad to see ye beneath my humble
roof,” said Rob earnestly, “and that ye havena’
forgotten poor, hopeless Robert Burns.”</p>

<p>Mackenzie led him to a chair. “Indeed, I have
not,” he replied brightly. “Believe me, Mr. Burns,
when I say that I prize your friendship above that
of all men I know.”</p>

<p>Robert was about to reply, when he caught sight
of Sir William Creech watching them impatiently.
He gave a great start and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Sir William Creech!” he said slowly and bitterly.
“To what do I owe this visit?”</p>

<p>“I come on a matter of business,” replied Sir
William, a flush rising to his cheek.</p>

<p>“What business can ye have with me noo?” asked
Robert with rising anger. “Perjurer, have ye come
to gloat over the man ye helped ruin by your
iniquitous falsehood? It isna’ good news ye bring,
I warrant ye, else ye would not be the bearer of it.”
And he gave a scornful little laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Insulting as ever, Robert Burns,” snarled Sir
William, a red spot of anger on each cheek, his
eyes flashing wickedly. “Well, I’ll state my business
briefly. Ye wrote to the Board of Commissioners
for the position of supervisor in the
excise. Your request has been voted on and was
refused.” He spat the words out with vindictive
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Refused!” gasped Rob incredulously. He had
felt so confident that the position would be given him.
He sat down weakly in his chair, dazed for a moment.
“But my name has been on the list of promotion for
months,” he told them dully.</p>

<p>“’Twas scratched off some weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Scratched off? and why?”</p>

<p>“Because of your Jacobite tendencies,” replied
Sir William coldly. “Many reports concerning
your disloyal sentiments to your country have
reached the Board, which utterly ruined any chance
ye might have had of promotion.”</p>

<p>Robert sat with bowed head, crushed by his disappointment.
“Again must I drink deeply of the
cup of humiliation and disappointment!” he cried
bitterly. Presently he looked up at Mr. Mackenzie
with a grim smile on his trembling face. “I am at
last persuaded, Mr. Mackenzie, that it was of me the
Hebrew sage prophesied when he foretold, ‘and behold,
on whatsoever this man doth set his heart, it
shall not prosper.’” His head dropped on his chest—his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
hands clenched the sides of the chair with despairing
intensity. Suddenly he jumped to his feet,
his face set and drawn, his eyes wild and flashing
with bitter anger. “My curse on those damned
informers, who have blasted my hopes,” he exclaimed
hoarsely. “May the devil be let loose to torture
them to madness.” Then he sank down in his chair
exhausted by his passion, his face pale and quivering.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie hastened to his side, fearful of the
consequences of the excitement on his frail constitution.
Presently Robert spoke again, but in a
weak, broken voice.</p>

<p>“My last hope is torn from me,” he said despairingly.
“What shall I do now? Ah, Mr. Mackenzie,
I have felt all the sweetness of applause in my short
life, but I am now experiencing the bitterness of the
after-taste.” And the pitiful little smile, the pathetic
catch in his voice, strangely moved the heart of his
listener.</p>

<p>“Pardon my question, Mr. Burns,” said he, “but
surely the excise allows you a salary?”</p>

<p>Rob laughed mirthlessly. “Aye,” he replied,
“the munificent sum of thirty pounds a year.”</p>

<p>“Thirty pounds a year!” repeated Mackenzie
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Aye, only half of which I am getting now,”
explained Robert bitterly. “Ye see I am ill and off
duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“And are there no royalties on your songs or
published collection coming to you?”</p>

<p>“Ask Sir William,” retorted Robert bitterly.</p>

<p>“There is no demand for your poems since you
left Edinburgh,” replied Sir William crustily. “The
youth Walter Scott has taken your place in their
regard. He shows a remarkable talent for rhyming.”
And a malicious smile appeared on his crafty
face as he noted the quick flush appear on the expressive
countenance of the sick man.</p>

<p>His quivering features betrayed how deeply the
barbed dart had entered his heart. He turned to Mr.
Mackenzie with a resigned little gesture. “Ye see,
sir,” he faltered with a pathetic smile, “how soon I am
forgot.” He paused, and the weak tears of sickness
welled up into his eyes; then he resumed with a
shade of bitterness, “Scott is sure to succeed, for
he is of noble birth. He’ll not be patronized, at
least.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie had been thinking deeply, and now
he turned to Robert with a resolute air. “Mr.
Burns,” he said earnestly, “with your consent, I will
go to the Board of Commissioners of Excise, of
which the Duke of Gordon is the chairman, and move
them to grant you full salary. They are well known
to me and I am sure will not refuse my request.”</p>

<p>A glad smile broke up Robert’s gloomy features.
“Ye are a friend, indeed!” he cried fervently. “God
grant they do not refuse you, for if they do, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
lay my account with an exit truly <i>en poète</i>, for if
I die not with disease, I must perish with hunger.”</p>

<p>“Your interference will do no good here, Mr.
Mackenzie,” hotly declared Sir William, glaring at
Robert hatefully.</p>

<p>“I think it will,” returned Mr. Mackenzie coolly.
“’Twould be Lord Glencairn’s wishes were he alive,
and his wishes will be respected by the Board, mark
well what I tell you,” and he flashed him a significant
look of defiance. Then turning to Robert, he shook
him by the hand and bade him adieu, saying that
he must return at once to Edinburgh. “And rest
assured,” he concluded, “I will inform you at once
of the decision of the Board, which without doubt
will be favorable. Cheer up, my man, Scotland will
not allow her ablest son to die of want and neglect,
if Henry Mackenzie can prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless ye!” responded Robert gratefully.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burns, if you——” began Mr. Mackenzie,
then he hesitated a moment, but finally after a moment’s
thought continued his sentence—“if you
will but accept a loan,” and his hand sought his
pocket, but Robert shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>“No, no, Mr. Mackenzie,” he said proudly; “I
canna’ accept it, thank ye.”</p>

<p>Mackenzie sighed. “Oh, you sensitive people,”
he remarked, “pride and poverty.”</p>

<p>“Ye see,” explained Robert gratefully, “I expect
a few pounds from the sale of a poem, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
will relieve my temporary embarrassment, and if
the commissioners grant me full salary, I can start
for the seaside, where I may regain my lost health.”
He passed his hand wearily over his brow, which
began to pain him, for the excitement had worn
him out. “But I fear that has flown from me forever,
that the voice of the Bard will soon be heard
among ye no mair.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” replied Mackenzie brightly, putting
his hand affectionately on Robert’s shoulder. “You
will live for years yet, but you must take better care
of this life which is so valuable to your family, to
your friends and to the world.” There was deep
concern in his pleasant voice and in his earnest eyes.</p>

<p>At that moment the street door opened and Eppy
appeared dressed youthfully in white, leading by the
hand none other than Souter Johnny, who was looking
decidedly crestfallen and sheepish, as he vainly
tried to pull down his little short kilt over his thin,
bony legs, for Souter was at last arrayed in full
kilts, much to his evident sorrow. He looked exceedingly
grotesque, squeezed into the suit, which
was too small even for his undersized frame.</p>

<p>“In the name of!—Souter Johnny, what means
this?” gasped Robert in amazement.</p>

<p>“Canna’ a man wear the kilts without being
laughed at?” answered Souter ruefully, resenting
the amused look on their faces.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say ye look better in breeches,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
observed Rob with a quizzical glance at Souter’s
grotesquely thin crooked legs.</p>

<p>“He wears them for my sake,” explained Eppy
with a soulful look at the uncomfortable Souter;
then she spied the visitors. “Why, Mr. Mackenzie,
it is good to see you here!” she exclaimed effusively,
and she made him a deep courtesy, purposely ignoring
Sir William.</p>

<p>“Daft as ever,” grunted Sir William audibly.</p>

<p>She regarded him with a haughty look of disdain.
“Daft!” she repeated. “Huh! you cannot insult
me now with impunity!” she exclaimed in triumph.
Turning to Souter, she called him to her side with
a commanding gesture.</p>

<p>“Noo, ye see, Robert, what has become of my
breeches,” whispered Souter in Robert’s ear as he
passed him. “She is wearing them,” and he winked
his eye significantly.</p>

<p>As he approached her, she reached out a long
arm and drew him to her so suddenly that it took
him off his feet. Finally he righted himself and
stood close beside her, his little gray head, with the
bonnet perched saucily on one side of it, scarcely
reaching to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Friends,” she announced proudly, “this gentleman
is my—my husband,” and she noticed with
pleasure the look of consternation which appeared
on all their faces.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Robert aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re married!” ejaculated Mr. Mackenzie
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Poor man,” sneered Sir William mockingly.</p>

<p>Eppy tittered gleefully. “Yes, I was married
to-day, and ’tis heavenly,” and she rolled her eyes
in an ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p>“Well, ’twas the best you could do, I suppose,”
observed Sir William maliciously.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take you as a gift,” she flashed.
“And you tried hard enough to win me, dear
knows,” she went on with total disregard for the
truth. “He was forever running after me,” she
explained deprecatingly to Souter.</p>

<p>“You—you—you are not speaking the truth,”
sputtered Sir William furiously. “If I was running
it was to get away from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course you won’t admit it now,” she
observed calmly. “But I am rejoicing that I didn’t
marry you.” She looked Souter over critically.
“Well, Souter may not be very handsome,” she
remarked thoughtfully after a pause, “but he is
a perfect picture in kilts,” and she gave a sigh of
absolute content.</p>

<p>“Women are queer creatures,” whispered Souter
to Robert deprecatingly, “and my—my wife, ahem!
weel, she’s the queerest of them a’.”</p>

<p>“Well, my friends,” laughed Mr. Mackenzie, “I
protest this time I must be off. Good-by, lad.”</p>

<p>“May blessings attend your steps and affliction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
know ye not,” answered Robert fervently. “Ye
might take Sir William along, for he looks maist
uncomfortable amongst honest people!” he added
dryly.</p>

<p>Mackenzie laughed grimly and passed out, leaving
Sir William to follow.</p>

<p>“Ye insulting pauper!” fumed Sir William, starting
angrily for the door.</p>

<p>“Ye can go back to your Edinburgh friends,”
cried Robert with flashing eyes, “an’ tell them that
e’en though ye found me almost on the verge of
despair, with oblivion hovering dark over my still
independent head, that I yet live in the hope of
seeing the prophecy I made to them all that night
fulfilled, and that Sir William Creech, my worst traducer,
will be the first one to again court my favor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hear no more such insulting language!”
roared Sir William threateningly.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll not hear it t’other side of the door,”
replied Robert quietly.</p>

<p>“Aye, but ye’ll get your fairin’ one of these
days,” exclaimed Souter belligerently. “An’ ’twill
be in hell, where they’ll roast ye like a herrin’,” he
added grimly, much to Eppy’s horror.</p>

<p>“Open the door for me, fellow!” shouted Sir
William wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Open it yoursel’,” replied Souter, “an’ I promise
ye I’ll shut it behind your coattails mighty quick.”</p>

<p>“Out of my way, idiot,” and with a shove he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
brushed the little man aside and swiftly joined his
waiting companion outside the gate.</p>

<p>“Did ye see that?” gasped Souter, his eyes flashing
fire. “Did ye see that? Let me get after him,”
and he started for the door, with blood in his eyes,
but Eppy with a little shriek of alarm grabbed
him by the plaidie and held on to him with all her
strength, which was not slight.</p>

<p>“Don’t, dearie, don’t, you might get hurt!” she
cried tearfully.</p>

<p>“Weel, if ye say not, why I’ll let him gae,” returned
Souter submissively.</p>

<p>“Come, Robert,” said Jean gently, “you must lie
down for a wee bit now.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Rob,” laughed Souter reminiscently,
“do ye mind the day——” He stopped short as
Jean shook her head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“He’s had a most exciting morning,” she exclaimed
gently, “and needs rest now. He’ll be feeling more
peart to-morrow,” and she held out her hand in
dismissal.</p>

<p>“Ye mean get out, eh, Mistress?” said Souter
good-naturedly. “Weel, weel, Souter Johnny can
take a hint.”</p>

<p>“Come, Souter,” called Eppy from the open doorway,
where she had been impatiently waiting for her
bridegroom, “come with me to your—your new
home,” and she bashfully held her fan over her face
with a nervous little giggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, that I will,” replied Souter, with alacrity.
He turned to Robert with a new air of dignity which
set comically upon his little figure. “If we can do
anything for ye, Robert, dinna’ forget to send over
to MacDougall House. Dinna’ forget my address.
Mrs. MacDougall, my arm.” She grabbed it quickly
and they walked to the door. “God-day all,” he
called over his shoulder, and with a feeling of great
contentment, that at last his troubles were over, and
that he was entering upon a new life of ease and
plenty, he closed the door behind them, and trotted
along beside his wife, grinning like a schoolboy,
across the fields to their new home.</p>

<p>“Has the Posty come yet?” inquired Robert, after
they had gone.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he brought no letter for ye,” answered
Jean sadly.</p>

<p>The words of one of the verses of his “Ode to a
Mouse,” came to him with gloomy presentiment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p>Later that day two men might have been seen galloping
their horses at full speed toward the little
house on the hillside. They were determined, resolute
looking men, evidently bent on serious purpose.
Finally they reached the gate, and dismounting made
their way to the door, the elder man insisting loudly
upon accompanying the other, much to his visible
annoyance.</p>

<p>“There is no need for secrecy, Gilbert Burns,”
said he grimly, and he followed him into the house
and to the room where Robert sat with pencil in hand
vainly courting his Muse. Jean, who was busily
engaged in sewing, jumped to her feet with a little
cry of amazement upon seeing her father before
her. Robert held out his hand to his brother in delighted
surprise, mixed with anxiety.</p>

<p>“Brother!” he cried, “what brings ye to Ellisland
in such haste? Is it bad news? Mother, our
sisters, are they ill?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Gilbert constrainedly. “They
are all well, Rob, and have sent their love to yourself
and family.”</p>

<p>“Thank God for that,” responded Robert thankfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
There was a little embarrassed silence, then
Gilbert spoke again.</p>

<p>“Robert, we—we are in sore trouble,” he confessed,
his face anxious and troubled.</p>

<p>“Trouble!” echoed Rob blankly. “What is
wrong, brother?”</p>

<p>“I cannot hold Mossgiel any longer,” he replied,
dejectedly. “The farm is but a wretched lease, as ye
know, an’ I canna’ weather out the remaining year.
Without assistance, Robert, I canna’ hope to hold
our little family together any longer.”</p>

<p>Robert’s heart sank within him as he heard the
direful news. He glanced at Squire Armour apprehensively.
“And Squire Armour?” he interrogated
with an angry glance at that gentleman, who stood
with a sneering smile on his harsh face, taking in the
evidences of poverty that surrounded them. And with
never a word of love or pity, nor of greeting to his
daughter who sat there with white face and longing
eyes, waiting to hear some news from her stern, implacable
father, of her loving mother at home.</p>

<p>“I have bought the lease of Mossgiel,” he growled,
“an’ if your brother canna’ pay up the back rent,
which is long past due, I shall seize everything and
turn the whole lot of them out, every one.”</p>

<p>Robert looked at him a moment in scornful silence.
Presently he spoke, and the cutting sarcasm of his
voice caused the old Squire to wince and drop his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye are a most just, square, God-fearin’ man,
Squire Armour,” he said. “The Kirk should be
proud of ye.” Turning to Gilbert, he asked him
the amount of his debt.</p>

<p>“Only a matter of £4, brother,” he replied, “but
’tis a fortune to me at present.”</p>

<p>“An’ I must have the money to-day or the farm,
I care not which.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” cried Jean, going to him, “do
not be hard on him; he will pay you; only give him
time.”</p>

<p>“Jean!” flashed Robert angrily, “dinna’ stoop
to ask mercy of that mon, even though he be your
own father.” Jean turned away with a sigh.</p>

<p>Squire Armour laughed derisively. “Ye’ll both
be on your knees before long, I’ll warrant,” he cried
harshly, “asking favors of me, especially when ye
have naught to feed a starving family. Ye have
made yoursel’ a fine, comfortable bed, my lassie,
havena’ ye?” He sneered sarcastically, turning to
his shrinking daughter. “But ’tis made, and ye can
lie on it, ye ungrateful minx.”</p>

<p>Robert rose quickly to his feet, his eyes flashing
dangerously.</p>

<p>“Stop! Squire Armour!” he commanded. “Dinna’
dare to use such language to my wife in my own
house, or weak, sick, and crippled as I am, I will
throw ye into the road like the cur that ye are.”
He stopped, breathless with indignation. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
he resumed with immeasurable scorn in his vibrating
voice, “An’ they call such men as ye Christians!
A sneaking, crawling, psalm-singing, canting hypocrite!
Faugh! Were I the Lord, I would sicken at
sight of ye.” He turned away and sat down beside
his now weeping wife, and there was pity and compassion
in the look he bestowed upon her.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of your blasphemy, Robert
Burns. If ye canna’ pay the rent for your brother,
my business is elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“I had no one else to turn to in this, my hour
of trouble,” murmured Gilbert brokenly. “If ye
can help me without impoverishing yoursel’, for
God’s sake do it, or I shudder to think what will
become of the dear ones at home.”</p>

<p>Robert was silent. He thought with anxious loving
concern of his own little flock, of the slender
resources at his command, of the gravity of his
own situation, sick as he was and with such gloomy
prospects staring him in the face—and yet was he
not better off after all than they at Mossgiel? Had
he not his salary, small as it was, and the promise
of the supervisorship, besides the money that Thompson
would pay him for his poem? He had much to
thank God for, he thought gratefully.</p>

<p>“I see ’tis no use delaying longer,” said Armour,
looking at the serious, downcast faces before him.
“I have given ye fair warning, Gilbert Burns, an’
noo I’ll go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>He had reached the door, when Robert spoke
quietly but firmly. “Wait!” he called. “Ye shall
have the money, ye Shylock.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried Gilbert with a loving glance
at his brother’s calm face.</p>

<p>Jean looked at him in speechless amazement.
What did he mean? How could he help others when
they were in such dire need themselves? she asked herself
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Robert,” she whispered anxiously, “ye dinna’
ken what ye say.”</p>

<p>“My brother will meet ye at sundown, at the Inn,”
continued Robert without heeding her warning, although
his face took on a whiter hue. “He will
bring ye every farthing of what is due ye. Noo
go; there is the door; your business here is ended.
Ye have brought naught but misery and trouble
into my life by your unreasonable hatred o’ me, but
the time will come, Squire Armour, when all the unhappiness
and suffering ye have caused me and mine
will rise up before ye like a hideous phantom, robbin’
ye of all peace o’ mind on earth, and your hopes of
salvation hereafter.” He drew nearer the gaping
man, who was regarding him with angry, sullen eyes,
and continued with a bitter, unforgiving intensity
that filled his listeners with awe and horror, “An’
when ye feel the chill icy hand of grim death clutching
at your heart, ye’ll cry out for the sympathy
and love of those whom ye cast out of your life, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
ye’ll cry in vain, an’ ye’ll die as ye have lived, a
miserable wretched ending to a miserable selfish
life.”</p>

<p>As he finished his grim prophecy, Squire Armour
gave a cry of nervous fear, and with blanched face
and wild eyes he strove to speak, but the words would
not pass his white, trembling lips. Finally he gasped
in a frightened whisper which gradually rose to
angry defiance:</p>

<p>“How dare ye! How dare ye say such things
to me, Robert Burns? I willna’ die like that and ye
canna’ frighten me with your grim forebodings.”
He paused and glanced at them all in turn, then
hastily opened the door. Just as he was stepping
out, he turned slowly and looked at the white, patient
face of his daughter. For a moment he regarded
her in silence, then with a visible effort he addressed
her.</p>

<p>“Jean,” he said, and his voice was noticeably
softer, “ye are welcome to come back to your home.”
He cast a quick look at the lowering face of his son-in-law
and added vindictively—“alone.”</p>

<p>“Nay, never alone, father,” replied Jean sadly,
looking at her husband’s frowning face.</p>

<p>The old man turned with sudden fury upon them.
“I’ll wait till sundown for my money,” he shouted,
“but not a minute longer!” and he closed the door
behind him with a vicious slam.</p>

<p>Gilbert was first to break the depressing silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that ensued. He felt vaguely that all was not
so well with his brother as he had been led to
believe.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, brother,” he murmured contritely,
“for bringing this trouble on ye.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Gilbert; it was to be, I ken,” answered
Rob absently.</p>

<p>Gilbert was silent a moment. “But the money,
Robert, is it—are ye——” he stammered, then
stopped in embarrassed confusion.</p>

<p>“’Tis the sum I expect from the sale of a
poem. Jean, see if there is aught of the Posty.”
She rose and went to the window and peered anxiously
down the dusty road.</p>

<p>“I didna’ have the ready money with me,” went
on Robert lightly, as if it were a matter of small
importance, “or I would have fixed it up at once.
But ye shall hae the money, laddie, when my letter
comes,” and he smiled reassuringly into Gilbert’s
anxious face.</p>

<p>“God bless ye, Robert; ye have taken a great load
off my heart.”</p>

<p>Jean returned to her seat by the hearth, and listlessly
took up her needlework. “I fear Posty has
forgotten us to-day,” she said in answer to Robert’s
questioning look.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘I’ll wait till sundown for my money,’ he shouted.”</p>
</div>

<p>A great fear seized his heart. For nearly a week
he had hopefully awaited some word from Thompson.
What could be the matter? “O God!” he prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
silently, “let him not fail me noo.” With a
bright smile that sadly belied his anxious heart, he
rose and, taking Gilbert’s arm, said gayly, “Come,
brother, and see the new bairn that has been added
to the flock this last year.”</p>

<p>As they left the room Jean dropped her work in
her lap and gazed after them with eyes filled with
helpless tears of anxiety, at the thought of the hardships
and suffering that lay in wait for them all.</p>

<p>After admiring the baby in the trundle bed the
two brothers talked of the dear ones in Mossgiel,
and the many changes time had wrought in the lives
of them all; spoke with tenderness of the sister who
had recently been married—and dwelt with anxious
concern on the struggles of their younger brother,
who had left home to branch out for himself. For
a time they forgot their own troubles, and Robert
plied his brother with many questions concerning the
welfare of all his old friends and neighbors, while
Gilbert told him all the gossip of the village, of the
prosperity of some of the lads, and the unfortunate
situations of many of the others, thus leading up to
the recital of their own troubles since Robert had left
his home. He listened sorrowfully to the tale of
hardship and unceasing toil which brought such
little recompense, but not by word or look did he
betray his own blighted hopes and gloomy prospects.
Finally they had exhausted every subject save one,
and that one had been uppermost in the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
both, but each had avoided the subject with a shrinking
dread.</p>

<p>No news of the little dairymaid had come to
Robert for almost a year, and the thought that
possibly she was ill or dead—or—and a hundred conjectures
racked his brain and froze the eager questions
that trembled on his lips. Gilbert must have
read the longing in his brother’s heart, for, after a
troubled glance at the dark yearning face gazing
at him so beseechingly, he looked down at his toil-worn
hands and awkwardly shifted one knee over the
other. Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>“Mary is still at Colonel Montgomery’s,” he
observed, making an effort to speak lightly.</p>

<p>“I heard she had left Mrs. Dunlop’s,” replied
Robert feverishly, moistening his lips with the tip of
his tongue.</p>

<p>“Aye,” sighed Gilbert. “She grew tired o’ the
city and longed for the stillness, the restfulness of
country life once more, so she came back to us and
took her old place in the dairy. Poor lass,” and
he looked thoughtfully out of the window and sadly
watched the glorious sunset tinting the distant hills
in a blaze of golden light.</p>

<p>“An’—an’ is she well—is she happy?” murmured
Robert in a soft, hushed voice. Gilbert did not
answer for a moment. Presently he roused himself
and slowly let his gaze wander back till it rested on
his brother’s wistful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can ye bear a shock, brother?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Robert suddenly stiffened and his eyes grew wide
and staring. He gripped the sides of the chair as a
wave of sudden dizziness dulled his understanding.
Presently it passed away, and like one in a dream
he whispered hoarsely, “Tell me the worst, Gilbert;
is—is she dead?”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and waited with breathless stillness
for the answer.</p>

<p>“Thank God, not that!” replied Gilbert feelingly.
Robert breathed a sigh of relief. “But she
is very ill, an’ I ken she hasna’ long on earth noo.
The doctors say there is no hope for her,” and he bit
his lips to keep back the rising tears.</p>

<p>Slowly, sorrowfully, Robert’s head drooped till it
rested on his bosom. For a moment he sat like one
on the verge of dissolution.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!” he moaned bitterly, “that sweet
young life crushed out in all its innocent purity, like
a delicate flower, and through my sin, my reckless
folly. Oh, how can I live and bear my punishment!”
A convulsive sob racked his weakened frame. Gilbert
bent over him with tears in his eyes, forgetting
his own crushing sorrow in witnessing that of his
brother.</p>

<p>“Dinna’ greet so, Robert,” he cried. “’Twas
not your fault, ye ken. It was to be.” His philosophical
belief in fate helped him over many a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and stony path, and enabled him to meet with calmness
and fortitude the many heartaches and disappointments
which befell him.</p>

<p>Soon the convulsive shudders ceased, and leaning
wearily back in his chair, Robert fixed his great
mournful eyes upon his brother in sorrowful resignation.</p>

<p>“How did she look when ye last saw her, Gilbert?”
he asked faintly, pressing his hand tightly
to his heart, for the old pain had come back with
exhausting results.</p>

<p>“Like an angel, lad,” replied Gilbert tenderly.
“So sweet and pure, so patient and forgiving.”</p>

<p>“Does she suffer much?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” he answered reassuringly. Then he
continued, his voice soft and low, his strong features
quivering from the restraint he put upon his feelings,
“Her life is just slowly slipping away from
her; day by day she grows weaker and weaker, but
ne’er a complaint is on her lips. She is always so
cheerful an’ smilin’ that it fair makes ye weep to see
her fadin’ awa’ so fast,” and his voice broke into a
hard sob.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary, my Highland Mary!” murmured
Robert brokenly.</p>

<p>“Her last wish is to see the Highlands, to—to die
there,” continued Gilbert, his lips contracting with
a sudden, sharp pain at the thought. “So before
she grows any weaker, Mrs. Dunlop, who has come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
from town to see her, and who is wi’ her noo, is goin’
to take her back to her old home in Argyleshire.”</p>

<p>“Going home to die!” repeated Robert dreamily.
“Oh, if I might be taken awa’ too, if my end would
only hasten,” he muttered despairingly, with the
weak selfishness of the sick and sorrowing. “Then
might our departing souls be united as one, to be
together for all eternity.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Robert!” cautioned Gilbert, looking
fearfully at the closed door. “Remember Jean and
the bairns.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert, I must see her before she goes!” he cried
utterly distracted. “’Tis for the last time on earth,
ye ken, lad,” and he jumped up, trembling with eager
excitement.</p>

<p>“Brother, would ye kill yoursel’?” cried Gilbert,
seeking to restrain him. “’Tis madness for ye to
go out in your weak condition.”</p>

<p>“Dinna’ stop me, Gilbert!” he panted, and he
flung open the door and rushed excitedly into the
room where Jean sat in patient meditation. “Jean,
get my bonnet and coat, quick, quick!” he commanded
with his old-time vehemence. She jumped
up pale and frightened and looked questioningly at
Gilbert. Quickly he told her of Mary’s illness and
Robert’s determination to go to her at once. When
he had finished she went to her husband, the tears of
ready sympathy in her eyes, for she was not jealous
of his love for Mary. She had gotten over that long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ago, and laying her hand gently on his arm, she
tried to coax him to sit down and listen to them.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to pass by here on their way to
Greenock,” she told him tenderly. “And ye may
be sure, Robert, that Mary will not leave Ayrshire
without saying good-by to you.” And so she reasoned
with him, while Gilbert joined her in assurances
of Mrs. Dunlop’s intention of stopping to see him
as she passed the farm. Gradually the wild light in
his eyes died down, the tense figure relaxed, and with
a sigh of exhaustion he allowed himself to be taken
back to his room.</p>

<p>“Ye’re sure she’ll not forget to stop here?” he
asked with pathetic eagerness. Then he continued
with wistful retrospection, “Two years have come
and gone and not a word have we spoken to each
other since that day we parted in Edinburgh! Oh,
cruel, cruel fate!” He spoke so low that none heard
him.</p>

<p>“Noo, Robert,” said Jean brightly, “you must
take your gruel, ’twill give ye strength.” But he
made a gesture of repulsion.</p>

<p>“Nay, Jean, I canna’ eat noo; ’twould choke me.
I think I’ll lay me down to rest.” They soon prepared
him for bed. Without a word, he turned his
face to the wall and for the rest of the night he lay
there with wide, staring, sleepless eyes, thinking,
thinking, thinking.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p>News of Robert’s illness soon reached Edinburgh,
along with reports of his misconduct, profligacy, and
intemperance, reports which were grossly exaggerated,
together with many other slanderous falsehoods.</p>

<p>And rumors of his poverty and the destitute
condition of his family brought sorrow and anxiety
to the hearts of many of his loyal friends, who
were only too ready and willing to offer him all
the help and assistance that would be needed, but
they knew, too, his inflexible pride and independence,
and realized how futile would be their offers of
friendly assistance.</p>

<p>For some days Lady Nancy Gordon had been
anxiously puzzling her brain for some thought
or scheme whereby she could help the unfortunate
Bard who was plunged in such depths of poverty
and misfortune. She was thinking of him now
as she sat at the harpsichord, her fingers wandering
idly over the keyboard in a running accompaniment
to her thoughts. Her father softly entered the room
at this juncture, but she did not turn her head nor
intimate that she was aware of his presence. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
her touch grew more and more tender. Anon
she glided into one of those dreamily joyous, yet
sorrowful, mazurkas, that remind one of gay wild
flowers growing in rich profusion over silent and forgotten
graves. Lady Nancy had reason to boast of
herself, for she was a perfect mistress of the instrument—and
as her fingers closed on the final chord, she
wheeled round abruptly on the chair, and rising to
her feet greeted her father with a tender smile. For
a moment she regarded him in thoughtful silence,
then as he laid down his paper, she walked up to
him, a frown of displeasure wrinkling her smooth,
white forehead.</p>

<p>“I think, father,” she said deliberately, with a
haughty uptilt of her pretty nose, “I think it is
perfectly disgraceful the way that hackney scribbler
who writes for yon journal,” indicating the
paper on the table, “either through malice or ignorance
affixes such degrading epithets to the name of
the Bard of Scotland, for by no other name will I
ever speak of Robert Burns,” and she flashed an
angry glance at the offending paper.</p>

<p>“Poor obstinate lad,” sighed the Duke thoughtfully.
His mind went back to the day after the
garden party at Glencairn Hall, when he had sent
for Robert to honor them with his presence at Gordon
House, and how the poet had taken offense at
some thoughtless remark of his, given in kindly
spirit; how with haughty pride, and wounded dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
he had gotten up from the table and after
thanking them for their hospitality, declared he had
not come to be insultingly patronized and pitied, and
refusing to listen to reason, or explanation, he had
left in bitter resentment and blind misunderstanding.
Lady Nancy too was thinking the same thoughts,
and after a moment’s meditation she looked into her
father’s kindly face and remarked earnestly:</p>

<p>“Father, something must be done for him and his
family at once.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear,” he meekly replied, “our hands
are tied by his own obstinacy.”</p>

<p>“Can we not get up a subscription for him?” she
asked. He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“’Twould be to no purpose, Nancy,” he returned
thoughtfully. “He would refuse all offers of pecuniary
aid. I know well his independent principles,
and so do you.”</p>

<p>They talked over many plans and projects, but
none seemed feasible, and they were about to give up
in despair, when Henry Mackenzie was announced.
He had just arrived from Ellisland, and immediately
spoke of his visit to the poet, and under what painful
conditions he had found him—told them of his
promise to Burns to secure the office of supervisor
for him, and had called to consult with his lordship
concerning its bestowal.</p>

<p>Nancy listened with bated breath and tear-dimmed
eyes as he spoke of the change in Robert, his poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
his indomitable courage and independence, in
spite of the ravages of disease and the black, gloomy
outlook for future prosperity.</p>

<p>“Nancy and I were just discussing some means
of alleviating his distress as you entered,” said the
Duke as Mr. Mackenzie finished his recital. “And
it affords me much gratification to be able to assist
him to the office of supervisor of the excise and its
attendant increase of salary.”</p>

<p>“’Twill be a God-send to him, believe me, my
lord,” returned Mr. Mackenzie feelingly.</p>

<p>“The news will be dispatched to him at once!”
cried Nancy with sparkling eyes. “’Twill relieve
his present distress of mind.”</p>

<p>With that assurance, Mr. Mackenzie rose, and
thanking them for their kindness in behalf of the
indigent poet, took his leave.</p>

<p>Having finished luncheon, the old Duke excused
himself, and going to his study, he made out the
necessary papers of promotion for the struggling
exciseman, with many a shake of his head and
pitying sigh for the young genius who was reduced
to such straits—driven to such a commonplace calling,
through his headstrong recklessness, his foolish
ideas of independence. Having signed them he sat
back in thoughtful meditation. Suddenly the door
opened, and his daughter asked permission to enter.
Having gained it, she crossed to her father, and
sinking down beside him, in an eager, impetuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
manner quickly laid before him a project which had
been formulating in her active brain while he was
busy writing out the papers.</p>

<p>He started back in amazement. “What!” he
cried. “Are you out of your senses, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“Now, papa, listen!” she exclaimed earnestly.
“’Twill take but a day’s ride to reach Dumfries,
and think how delighted he will be to receive the
promotion from your hands,” and she slyly noted
the effect of the bit of delicate flattery.</p>

<p>He frowned and pursed his lips for a moment, and
idly tapped the folded papers against his knee in
thought. These signs boded success, as Nancy well
knew, and springing to her feet she gave him a big
hug that set him gasping.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mistress Nancy!” he exclaimed as
soon as he recovered his breath, “why do you
want to take this wearisome journey at this season
of the year, just to visit the home of this poor
exciseman?” and he wonderingly regarded the face
that had suddenly grown flushed and pensive, as she
looked with worshipful eyes at the large engraving
over the fireplace, which contained the figure of
Burns in a characteristic attitude, reading one of
his poems to the group of people that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>“I want to see him once more before the fire of
his genius grows cold,” she answered dreamily. “I
want to see him in his home with his—his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
children around him.” She might have told him
that she was heart-hungry for a sight of that dark,
glowing face, the flashing black eyes that had
thrilled her with such blissful pain, for the sound of
that rich, majestic voice, that had so often stirred
the uttermost depths of her heart. She felt that the
yearning of her soul would not be satisfied till she
had seen him again, spoken with him. She hoped,
yet dreaded, that the sight of his changed face, his
miserable surroundings, the commonplaceness of it
all, of meeting the exciseman with his wife and children
around him, rather than the idealized poet,
would silence forever the strange unrest of her soul,
banish all thoughts of sentiment from her mind, and
destroy the spell of glamour which he had all unconsciously
thrown about her. These thoughts flew
through her mind with lightning speed while her
father was making up his mind how best to dissuade
her from her purpose.</p>

<p>“I fear me, Nancy, ’twill give us both more pain
than pleasure,” he said finally. “We may even lose
our respect for him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, father!” she cried reproachfully.
“No matter how low he may have fallen, and
I protest that fame has exaggerated his misconduct
woefully, we people of Scotland cannot forget nor
overlook the priceless treasure he has put into our
thankless hands, a treasure that will be handed down
to posterity with ever increasing regard, admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and love for its author,” and her flashing blue eyes,
that had so often reminded Robert of Mary Campbell,
and which had formed a closer tie of comradeship
between them, again sought and lingered upon
the engraved likeness of her hero. The singular
beauty of Lady Nancy Gordon was illumined by that
happy expression of countenance which results from
the union of cultivated tastes and superior understanding
with the finest affections of mind, and the
influence of such attractions had been keenly felt by
the ardent poet, who was not altogether unaware of
the impression he had made upon her heart, which
was as susceptible to the charms of wit and intellect
as was his own. As she stood gazing up at the picture,
she thought with an odd little smile how she
had openly sought for his favors, delighted in his
apparent preference for her society even while she
told herself she knew he was only attracted by her
brilliancy—that she appealed to his intellect—charmed
him by her wit, her cleverness. No, she
had never touched his heart, she thought with a
sigh, and a look of sadness came into her thoughtful
eyes.</p>

<p>“I fear, Nancy, that Robert still harbors feelings
of resentment against us,” protested the Duke
after a pause. “I know he would rather not see
us.”</p>

<p>But Lady Nancy overruled his objection. “Then
all the more reason for our assuring him of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
friendship and asking his forgiveness for any offense
we have unintentionally offered him.”</p>

<p>Seeing all arguments were useless, the old Duke
finally consented, and with a hug and a kiss, Nancy
left him and proceeded to make arrangements for
their speedy departure for Ayrshire.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p>The next morning dawned bleak and dismal. A
damp, penetrating mist hung over the farm like a
pall, and the chill of the rain-laden air penetrated
into the rooms and made itself felt even by the side
of the brightest fires. It affected the inmates of Ellisland
farm to an alarming extent. They sat gloomily
around the hearth idly watching the smoldering peat
fire, which failed to send out much warmth—as if
it, too, felt the depressing influences which surrounded
the little household and which had plunged
them all into such a slough of despond.</p>

<p>Robert had partaken of his bowl of porridge and
now lay upon his bed, grateful for the added warmth
of the woolen blankets which Jean had thrown over
him with thoughtful solicitude. He appeared to
the anxious watchers to be more like himself than he
had been for some days, in spite of his restless, sleepless
nights, as he lay there peacefully enjoying the
antics of the children who were playing gleefully but
quietly around the room their favorite game of
“Blind man’s holiday.”</p>

<p>At sundown the night before Gilbert had hastened
to the Inn to meet Squire Armour and to plead for
another day’s grace, but the implacable old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
refused to listen to him when he found he had failed
to bring the money, and stormily took his departure
with threats of instant eviction, leaving Gilbert in
a state of utter distraction. He watched the Squire
ride furiously away in the direction of Mossgiel
with a heavy, sinking fear at his heart, then slowly
made his way, with pale face and clenched hands,
back to his brother’s cottage, where he wrestled with
the fears that assailed him in despairing silence.
Several times during the night he was on the verge
of saddling his horse and dashing home, but the hope
that the morning would bring the long-expected
letter to Robert checked the impulse, and so he sat
the long night through anxiously waiting for the
dawn, praying fervently that he might not be too
late to save his dear ones from the vindictive
anger, the unyielding resolution of their irate landlord.</p>

<p>And now morning was here at last. Robert had
fallen into a profound slumber of nervous exhaustion.
Jean tucked him in carefully with the warm blankets,
and taking the children with her, quietly closed the
door upon the sleeping man with a prayer of thankfulness
for his temporary respite from the troubles
that surged about his head.</p>

<p>When her duties were over and the children
playing on the green, Jean took her sewing and
joined Gilbert in the living room. He was walking
restlessly up and down, with nervous, flashing eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
that eagerly searched the road, as he passed and
repassed the small window. His restless pacing, his
look of hopeful anxiety smote Jean to the heart, for
she had been bitterly resentful, and was still in a
measure, against Gilbert’s selfishness in thinking
only of his own extremity. It didn’t seem right or
just that he should be here with outstretched hands,
waiting to take the money that meant so much to
their own struggling family at the present time, and
without which she could only foresee grim want staring
them all in the face—and she had to struggle
with the desire that rushed over her to rise up and
tell him of their bitter plight, to bid him go
elsewhere for assistance; but the fear of Robert’s
anger kept her silent. Then, too, she suddenly
remembered that they had both kept their poverty
and Robert’s continued ill luck and failures from the
home folk, and it was only to be expected that
Gilbert would naturally turn to his prosperous
brother for assistance. “Prosperous, indeed! If he
but knew,” and she sighed deeply, for her mother’s
heart felt sore depressed as she thought of her own
loved ones. They did not talk much. Each was
too busy with his own gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p>In fancy, Gilbert could see Squire Armour at Mossgiel
Farm, ordering out his mother and sister, watching
them with sinister eyes as they got together
their meager belongings, and then when they, with
streaming eyes, had carried out the last piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
furniture and stood gazing at the home that was no
longer theirs, the cruel landlord had heartlessly
laughed at their sorrow and, locking the door, had
ridden away with the keys in his pocket, leaving
them standing there not knowing whither to go nor
where to find food or shelter.</p>

<p>“O God! Not that! Not that!” he cried aloud,
pausing in his walk with clenched hands, pale and
wild-eyed.</p>

<p>Jean looked up from her work in startled alarm.
“Gilbert!” she cried. “What is it?”</p>

<p>With a little mirthless laugh, he told her of the
vision he had had, told of his fears for the safety
of his home and the welfare of his loved ones.</p>

<p>She listened with a feeling of shame at her heart
and a flush of angry humiliation mantling her pale
cheek.</p>

<p>“’Fore Heaven, it makes me feel like cursing
even the memory of my father,” she exclaimed bitterly
with a flash of her old-time imperiousness.
“But be not alarmed, Gilbert,” she continued with
an encouraging smile. “Your mother is a match
even for my father, and I’ll warrant she’ll not let
him set his foot inside the threshold till you return.”
His face brightened.</p>

<p>“I had indeed forgot my mother’s independent,
courageous spirit,” he replied with a sigh of relief
and hopefulness.</p>

<p>The depressing gloom thus lifted, they soon drifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
into a friendly, earnest conversation, and the minutes
sped by without, however, the looked-for interruption
of the overdue postman.</p>

<p>Outside, the mist had long since been dispersed by
the warm rays of the noonday sun, which was now
shining brilliantly. A soft moisture glittered on
every tiny leaf of the wild rose bushes which clustered
beneath the window of the little cot, and on every
blade of grass. The penetrating and delicious odor
of sweet violets and blue-bells scented each puff of
wind, and now and then the call of the meadow lark
pierced the air with a subdued far-off shrillness. Suddenly
the peaceful stillness was broken in upon by
the sound of footsteps crunching slowly along
the garden path on their way to the door of the
cottage.</p>

<p>The Duke of Gordon and his daughter had arrived
in Dumfries the night before, and, after a night’s rest,
they took the coach to Ellisland and put up at the
little old Inn. There they made inquiries for the
whereabouts of the home of the poet of the little
old man who was boastfully describing the splendors
of MacDougall House, none other than our old friend
Souter, once more in his breeches, having asserted his
authority, much to his wife’s secret satisfaction, for
“she did so love a masterful man.” Whereupon
Souter condescendingly offered to conduct them to
the place they sought. And now, as they looked at
the poor clay biggin and the evidences of poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and neglect which surrounded them on all sides, their
hearts sank within them.</p>

<p>“I suppose we will find Mr. Burns greatly
changed?” said Nancy interrogatively with a little
shudder of dread.</p>

<p>“Weel, mum,” replied Souter reflectively, “we
all change in time, ye ken. Some for worse, like
mysel’, and some for the better, like yoursel’, askin’
your pardon for my boldness. And ye ken Robbie’s
life has been very hard these past few years.” He
sighed and shook his head dolefully. “But I want
to say right here,” and his heavy eyebrows drew
together in a black scowl, “Robbie Burns’ sickness
is na’ due to his drinkin’, as ye people of Edinburgh
believe, and put in yer penny papers. Robbie is
na drunkard. I hae known him from infancy, and I
affirm that he has never been guilty of the gross
enormities he has been charged with. He could
always attend to his duties,” and he looked with
aggressive suspicion into the downcast faces of his
listeners for some sign of doubt of his assertion,
which, though stanchly loyal, was not altogether true,
as he knew only too well. “But there is nae use
telling all ye know,” he told himself philosophically.
“And what people don’t know about the food they
eat, will no hurt their appetites.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear that,” ejaculated the
Duke warmly.</p>

<p>“An’ he is a fond father an’ a maist affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
husband,” continued Souter stoutly. “I’ll go in
noo and tell him ye’re here,” and he strode into the
house, leaving the couple standing in the path much
to their astonishment.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem right, father,” said Lady Nancy
sadly, “for such genius to dwell in that little hut,
amid such surroundings. How I pity him.”</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of tears in the sweet voice
which her fond father noticed with sudden apprehension.
He looked at her closely.</p>

<p>“Who is to blame for his being here?” he retorted
firmly. She remained discreetly silent. Then he
continued in a softer voice, “But I mustn’t blame
nor censure him, now that he is sick, and down at
the bottom again. It is, indeed, a lasting pity that
such genius should be allowed to smother here in
poverty and among questionable companions, who,
’tis said, seek only to bring him to their level, and
who, alas! are but too surely dragging him there, I
fear, a weak, unresisting, but also a remorseful,
repentant victim.”</p>

<p>“And must he stay on here, father, to die a poor
exciseman?” asked Nancy with a strangely beating
heart. “Even the added salary of the Supervisorship
cannot be sufficient to keep such a family.” At
that moment Souter opened the door. They turned
to him quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, what says Mr. Burns?” asked the Duke
impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>A little smile of amusement appeared on Souter’s
face. “Mr. Burns begs you to enter and to be
seated,” he replied.</p>

<p>They complied with the injunction and were shown
into the living-room, where they seated themselves.</p>

<p>“I was also to tell ye,” continued Souter dryly,
“that he will be with ye as soon as he can get into
his damned rags.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the Duke laughingly.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, your ladyship,” answered Souter
with a little nod to Lady Nancy, “but them’s his
own words and I’m no the one to change the language
o’ a Scottish poet.”</p>

<p>“Has he only rags to wear?” asked Lady Nancy
pitifully.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned her father, “he is here.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Robert slowly entered the
room. He had thrown his wide plaid around his
shoulders, over his loose white shirt, and held it
together with one hand that gleamed very white
and thin against the bright colors. His black hair,
now faintly streaked with gray and which had thinned
considerably above his forehead, hung loosely about
his neck, framing his gaunt face, and accentuating
his pallor.</p>

<p>For a moment they gazed upon the wreck of the
once stalwart and ruggedly healthy youth, too
shocked to utter a word. Robert was the first to
break the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>“My lord,” he exclaimed with something of his
old brightness, “I am rejoiced, indeed, to see you
at Ellisland. ’Tis a great surprise, but none the
less a welcome one.” He shook the Duke’s outstretched
hand with fervor.</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mutual, my lad,” responded the
Duke warmly. “’Tis a few years now since we
parted, and in anger, too.”</p>

<p>“I was in the wrong that night,” broke in Robert
penitently, with a rueful shake of the head. “I sadly
misjudged ye there, as I learned afterward, but my
stubborn pride refused to accept the olive branch ye
held out to me. Ye see,” he explained frankly,
“’twas my unreasoning wounded pride and anger,
and my disappointment which blinded me to all sense
of right and justice. I realized after that ye were
my friends and that ye resented the damning insult
put upon me at Glencairn Hall.” He paused a
moment, a frown of bitterness wrinkling his brow.
Presently he looked up and holding out his hand
again with one of the old magnetic smiles, said, “An’
ye have forgiven my ingratitude, an’ are come noo
to see me! I thank ye.”</p>

<p>“’Tis all forgot. I forgave you at the time,”
responded the Duke cordially. “I could not hold
resentment against you.” He turned to his daughter,
who was partly concealed in the embrasure of
the deep window.</p>

<p>“Nancy, child, speak to Robert.” She came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
slowly forward with hand outstretched, a faint flush
dyeing her creamy skin, or perhaps it was the reflection
of the pink satin gown she was wearing beneath
the long velvet cloak, which, becoming unhooked, had
slipped down off her shoulders.</p>

<p>Robert rose to his feet, and his black, gloomy
eyes lighted up with pleasure as they rested upon the
dainty vision of loveliness before him. Lady Nancy
had always reminded him of Mary Campbell, and
to-day the resemblance was more striking than ever.
For beneath the large leghorn with its waving, black
plumes, her golden hair so like Mary’s, for the once
unpowdered, glittered in all its beauty. Perhaps
my Lady Nancy had remembered the likeness and
had purposely heightened it by forgetting to use
the powder which had hitherto covered the golden
curls at all times. As she stood there with a wistful
look upon her face, it was easy to perceive the resemblance
to the timid dairymaid who, in borrowed
finery, had created such a sensation at the Duchess
of Athol’s “at home” three years before.</p>

<p>“Lady Nancy, forgive my rudeness in not greeting
you sooner,” he exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p>“I am so glad we are reconciled, friends, once
more,” she exclaimed impulsively. “It did seem as
if you would never relent, you stubborn man,” and
she smiled archly into his embarrassed face.</p>

<p>“You find me greatly changed, of course,” he
remarked after they had discoursed a while upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
their journey. She remained silent, but he read the
sympathy shining in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“We read of your illness in town,” explained the
Duke, “and believe me, Robert, we are deeply sorry
for your affliction. But I trust the vigor of your
constitution will soon set you on your feet again,”
and he gave him a cheery smile of encouragement.</p>

<p>Robert shook his head gloomily. “My health is,
I think, flown from me forever,” he replied sadly,
“altho’ I am beginning to crawl about the house,
and once, indeed, have I been seen outside my cottage
door.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let us know of your illness
before?” exclaimed Lady Nancy reproachfully.
“We are your friends.”</p>

<p>Robert flushed painfully. “My miserable health
was brought on and aggravated solely by my headstrong,
thoughtless carelessness, and I felt so heartily
ashamed of myself that I sought to conceal from all
friends my real condition, but ’tis out at last. How
long I will be confined to the house, God alone
knows,” and he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Do not give yourself up to despondency, my
lad,” encouraged the Duke brightly, “nor speak the
language of despair. You must get well.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I must!” returned Robert grimly, “for
I have three strong, healthy boys and if I am nipt
off at the command of fate—gracious God! what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
would become of my little flock?” and a look of
distraction swept over his face at the thought.</p>

<p>“Don’t distress yourself needlessly, Robert!” exclaimed
the Duke kindly. Then he continued earnestly,
“If anything should happen to you, if you
should be taken off before I am called, I promise
that the children of Robert Burns shall never come
to want.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be a lasting disgrace to Scotland,”
flashed Lady Nancy with kindling eyes.</p>

<p>Robert grasped the Duke’s hand impulsively.
“God bless ye for your noble assurance!” he cried.
“Ye have lifted a heavy weight of care and anxiety
off my mind.”</p>

<p>“Why, father!” suddenly exclaimed Lady Nancy,
“I vow if you are not forgetting your principal
errand here.” He looked at her with a puzzled
frown. “Mr. Burns’ promotion,” she reminded him
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Gad zooks!” he exclaimed in amazement, jumping
to his feet. “What an old dolt I am, to be sure.”
Hastily diving his hand in the inside pocket of his
elaborate, black-flowered satin square-cut, he
pulled out a long paper with a red seal attached
and handed it to the now bewildered Robert, who,
after a quick glance at their smiling faces, opened
the paper and quickly read its contents. Then he
gave a gasp, followed by an ejaculation of delighted
surprise and gratification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>“My lord,” he exclaimed, “this is indeed a gift
to bring gladness to a man’s heart. I thank ye
most gratefully for my promotion, and will endeavor
to perform my duties to the best of my poor abilities
as soon as my strength returns.” And the look
of anxiety gave way to one of comparative contentment.</p>

<p>“And your immediate recovery is of the first
importance,” returned the Duke brightly. “You
need a change.”</p>

<p>“Why not come to town, where you can have the
best of medical attendance?” asked Lady Nancy
quietly, though her heart beat furiously as she offered
the suggestion.</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” replied Robert. “The
medical folk tell me that my last and only chance
is bathing and sea air and riding. With my promotion
and the increase of salary it brings, I can
now obey their mandates,” and he held the paper
to his breast with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Then the sooner you start, the better,” remarked
the Duke kindly.</p>

<p>Lady Nancy rose to her feet with a wan smile on
her lips. “And the sooner we start for Dumfries,
father, the better,” she returned.</p>

<p>“You’re right, child, we must hasten,” and he
hastily arose and got his hat and cane together,
then he turned once more to Robert. “Mr. Burns,
pardon the suggestion, but is it not time to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
out another volume of your poems?” he asked
kindly.</p>

<p>“I have not in my present state of mind much
appetite for exertion in writing,” answered Robert
slowly.</p>

<p>“But they could be arranged for you by some
literary friend,” quickly returned the Duke, “and
advertised to be published by subscription.”</p>

<p>Robert raised his head proudly. “Subscription!”
he repeated. “No, no, that savors too much
of charity,” and a look of obstinacy came into his
darkened eyes.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said Lady Nancy gently, “that
Pope published his Iliad by subscription, Mr.
Burns.”</p>

<p>He remained silent a moment, then after a little
struggle with his obstinate pride, he answered with a
touch of bitterness in his voice, “I realize that I
am in no position to despise any means to add to
my income or to leave my family better provided
for after I am gone. I will take your advice and will
at once speak to my dear friend Aiken about it.
He will aid me.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Jean entered the room. She
had heard all the good news, and having met both
the Duke and Lady Nancy while sojourning at Glencairn
Castle a few years before, she felt she ought to
thank them for their good offices in Robert’s behalf.</p>

<p>Lady Nancy and the Duke greeted her warmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
asked after the health of the children, expressed
pleasure in seeing her again, and soon put her at her
ease, for the sudden thought of her hasty marriage
to Robert and the attendant slanderous gossip at first
made her feel and appear self-conscious and
restrained.</p>

<p>“I was just telling Robert,” said the old Duke,
“that he must go at once to the seashore.” She
looked at her husband, and her wistful expression did
not escape the keen eyes of Lady Nancy.</p>

<p>“If he only could go at once,” faltered Jean, “I
am sure the water would effect a cure, but——”</p>

<p>Nancy gave her father a significant look, which
clearly said, “They have no money, father.” At
least, so he interpreted it, aided by his own shrewd
guess at the state of affairs.</p>

<p>“By the way, Robert,” he said jocularly, “can
you swallow your pride sufficiently to accept a month’s
salary in advance?” He pulled out a large, well-filled
wallet and opened it.</p>

<p>“We do not need it, my lord,” answered Robert
firmly and a trifle coldly. “I am expecting——”
Here Jean hurriedly interrupted him, knowing what
he was about to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert!” she cried contritely, “I forget to
tell you that the Posty left no letter.”</p>

<p>“No letter!” he repeated dully, looking at her
with wide-open, searching eyes. She sadly shook
her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here are £5, lad. Take the note and to-morrow
set out for Brow,” and the Duke held out the note
for his acceptance, but he sat with averted gaze in
the proud silence of keen disappointment.</p>

<p>“Do not refuse, Robert,” pleaded Jean softly.
“’Tis only a loan.”</p>

<p>Slowly he took the money and folded it between
his fingers. “Thank ye, my lord,” he said quietly.
“I will accept it, for I am in sore need of it at this
moment.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, my lad,” he said heartily. “What
is a friend for if he cannot extend or receive a
favor?” and he turned to help his daughter into
her cloak.</p>

<p>Quickly Robert pressed the money into Jean’s
hand and whispered to her, “Take it at once to
Gilbert and bid him hasten to Mossgiel before it
is too late to save the roof over mother’s head.”</p>

<p>“But, Robert——” she protested, but he would
not listen to her.</p>

<p>“Do ye not see ’tis near sundown of the second
day?” he told her impatiently, “and Gilbert will
have to ride fast if he would get to Mossgiel before
night overtakes him; noo hasten, Jean.” Still she
lingered, reluctant to go.</p>

<p>“Oh, lad, this money is for you; it means your
health, our happiness. It isn’t right to——”</p>

<p>“We have got a roof over our head, Jean,” he
interrupted sternly. “We maist keep one over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
mother and sister as weel. We will nae starve.
There are only £4 due your father. Keep out one
for our present needs. Noo go, lass, go.”</p>

<p>Thus commanded, she hurried to the chamber where
Gilbert sat in despairing solitude, his head held
wearily between his hands, and conveyed to him the
glad intelligence. And soon he was speeding furiously
over the dusty road toward home, his face
aglow with joy and eagerness.</p>

<p>When Jean returned to the room she found
Souter and Eppy there gayly chatting with the Duke
and Lady Nancy, who were evidently much surprised
to find their old friend Eppy at last married.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you here, Lady Nancy,”
gushed Eppy effusively. “You must come and see
us before you return to Edinburgh. I live on the
estate adjoining this farm.” He drew the smiling
girl to the window and pointed out the beauties
of MacDougall House. “He is poor,” she whispered,
“but he is of noble birth, a MacDougall of
Lorne. Souter!” she called aloud to her husband,
who was looking exceedingly important as he stood
balancing himself on his toes, his hands behind his
back, a look of supreme self-satisfaction on his face,
and listening, with an air of blasé indifference, to
the conversation between the old Duke and Robert.
As he heard his name called he leisurely turned his
head in his wife’s direction.</p>

<p>“Souter,” she continued in a tone meant to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
careless, but which expressed plainly her feeling of
pride, “isn’t it the Marquis of Lorne who is your
first cousin?”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Souter?” asked Robert incredulously.</p>

<p>Souter looked around him with a sickly smile. He
had not thought to be cornered in this manner, when
he had filled his wife’s mind with stories of past
grandeur and noble connections, and it made him
feel decidedly uncomfortable and embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Er—didna’ ye ken that, Robbie?” he exclaimed
with a look of feigned surprise on his reddened face.
“Och, yes! By the by, Robbie,” he continued
quickly, anxious to change the subject, “we came
o’er to tell ye that we are gang to Brow on our
honeymoon.” Here Eppy giggled and looked bashfully
out of the window. “An’ my wife, Mrs. MacDougall,”
with a flourish of the hand in her direction,
which elicited another giggle from the lady in question,
“has decided that we want ye to gang alang
wi’ us.”</p>

<p>Robert looked at him, then at Eppy in speechless
surprise. Jean gave a little gasp, and her hand
sought her husband’s arm and pressed it with
delight.</p>

<p>“Souter,” faltered Robert, “ye’re both doing
this out of the kindness of your hearts, but I
canna——”</p>

<p>“We’ll na take no for an answer. Ye may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
stubborn wi’ your lofty independence, your pride,
but I can be just as stubborn as ye, Rab Burns, and
I say it is settled,” said Souter.</p>

<p>“’Tis the hand of God,” whispered Jean softly.</p>

<p>“God bless ye both,” faltered Robert, grasping
Souter’s hand affectionately.</p>

<p>“Come, father,” said Lady Nancy, who had witnessed
this little scene with moist eyes, “I protest
we must start on our journey.”</p>

<p>“But first we must have a toast,” said Robert
brightly. “’Tis most fitting. Jean, bring the
punch bowl.” Quickly she brought from the closet
the bowl of Inverary marble and placed it on the
table, and into it she poured some hot water and
sugar. “We have no wine to offer,” continued Robert,
“nothing better than Highland whisky, but ye
needna’ be afraid of becoming intoxicated, my lord,”
and he smiled ruefully, “for I ken ’twill hardly be
tolerable to your educated taste.” Jean had mixed
the punch and now passed it around among the
guests. “For auld lang syne!” cried Robert feelingly.
“Is not that phrase most expressive? My
lord, a toast,” and he raised his glass to the old
Duke, who, after a moment’s hesitation, proposed
“the health of Robert Burns, Scotland’s greatest
Bard.”</p>

<p>“We drink to that with pleasure,” exclaimed Lady
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Aye, that we do,” echoed Souter heartily. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
while the toast was being drunk he slyly whispered,
“Rob, dinna’ say aught to my wife about—er—the
old Marquis, my—ahem—cousin. Ye understand,”
and he nudged him significantly.</p>

<p>Robert smiled and assured him of his secrecy.</p>

<p>“And noo,” said Souter proudly, looking at
Eppy’s simpering face, “here’s to the bride.” She
made a deep courtesy and quaffed her glass with conscious
dignity at her sudden importance. “May she
always believe in her husband,” he added in an aside
to Robert, much to the latter’s amusement.</p>

<p>“Mrs. MacDougall, here’s to your enemies, your
foes,” proposed Robert.</p>

<p>“What?” she cried, opening her eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>“May they have short shoes an’ corny toes,” he
added with a merry twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Duke, a toast!” said Souter importantly.</p>

<p>The Duke thought a moment. “Well, I drink to
Mrs. MacDougall. May she soon have a house full
of bairns,” he thoughtlessly proposed.</p>

<p>Eppy gasped and turned crimson, and Lady
Nancy bit her lips to keep back the smile her father’s
well-meant but tactless speech occasioned.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insult me, my lord?” flashed
Eppy indignantly.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, no,” returned the Duke in astonishment,
who could see no reason for offense in his
kindly-meant remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Duke meant well,” said Souter pacifically
to his wife, whose eyes were flashing angrily.
“An’—an’—stranger things might happen, ye ken,”
and he rubbed his chin reflectively with a sly look
out of the corner of his roguish eye at Robert. She
tossed her head haughtily.</p>

<p>“’Twould not be so monstrous strange, Mr. MacDougall,
as you seem to think,” she retorted frigidly.
Souter opened his eyes in speechless surprise. He
was about to speak, but after one bewildered glance
at the disdainful face of his bride, concluded that
discretion was the better part of valor, and for the
rest of that day he remained in thoughtful silence
reflecting on the inconsistencies of woman kind
in particular, and speculating upon the strange
and mysterious workings of human nature in general.</p>

<p>The Duke bade them all adieu and passed out into
the garden, where its wild beauties attracted his
eye. He wandered about, forgetting, in his admiration
for the flowers, his daughter, who had lingered
behind for one last farewell word—alone.</p>

<p>“And so, Mr. Burns,” she said thoughtfully, looking
after Jean’s retreating figure, “you have never
regretted taking the step that bound your life to
that of Jean Armour’s? Regretted doing your
duty?” There was a note of regret in the vibrating
voice.</p>

<p>“Never, my lady,” he replied firmly. “It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the only really good thing I have ever done in my
wretched life.”</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment with hungry eyes.
“Do you never think of the old days in town?” she
asked suddenly, and she was greatly surprised to
see his face turn pale, his eyes flash and deepen.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, madam, do not mention the
past!” he said, turning away. “All that has passed
out of my life forever,” he murmured after a pause,
“never to return.”</p>

<p>“And you wish it so?” she asked faintly. He
bowed his head slowly. She moistened her lips feverishly
and drew near to him, her eyes filled with a
light that would have startled him had he seen it.
“Say not so! Must I give up the friendship of the
only man I esteem and hold dear?” she panted
breathlessly. “Oh, will you not renew the broken
thread of our correspondence [he had written her
several times since coming to Ellisland, but before
Jean’s advent] and enjoy the sweet intercourse of
thought, which will bring such gladness into my
own life, and will brighten the gloom of your own,
and will take naught from your wife’s peace of
mind?”</p>

<p>He raised his head and regarded her thoughtfully.
“How can ye ask me that, my lady,” he answered,
“when ye declared to me in your last letter that you
meant to preserve my epistles with a view, sooner
or later, to expose them to the pillory of derision and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the rocks of criticism?” And a look of resentment
gleamed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I protest, Mr. Burns,” she cried reproachfully.
“I have, indeed, preserved your letters, but they will
never leave my possession; they are cherished as the
dearest treasures of my life.”</p>

<p>He sighed and remained silent for a space. From
the kitchen came the sound of children’s voices. He
listened to it a moment, then turned to Lady
Nancy, a look of resolution in his face.</p>

<p>“Lady Nancy,” he said firmly, “I canna’ write
to ye in sincerity. I have a wife and family, an’ I
have given my word to Jean, and while I dare to sin,
I dare not to lie, else madam I could perhaps too
truly join grief with grief, and echo sighs to thine.
But with one foot in the grave, I have no desire
to stir up the old ashes of—friendship to find a living
ember. ’Twould be but a weak, fitful burning at best.
Nay, ’tis too late noo. Believe me, ’tis best, dear
lady.” He rose to his feet and held out his hand
again. “An’ noo farewell, Lady Nancy, farewell.”</p>

<p>She took his hand and looked into his set, unmoved
face, and a sigh of utter disappointment, of patient
longing, involuntarily escaped her trembling lips.
“If it must be, then farewell,” she answered slowly,
a slight tremor in her soft voice. She walked to the
door, then turned and fixing her eyes on him, she
continued mournfully, “Do not quite forget me, will
you, Robert? Let the scenes of nature remind you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of Nancy. In winter remember the dark shades of
her life, for there are plenty; in summer, the warmth
of her friendship; in autumn, her glowing wishes to
bestow plenty on all, and let spring animate you with
hopes that your absent friend may yet surmount the
wintry blasts of life, and revive to taste a springtime
of happiness.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head gravely. “I shall remember
ye, Lady Nancy—friend,” he returned feelingly.</p>

<p>She gave him one long, lingering look. “Farewell,
farewell!” she gasped, and when he raised his
head she was gone.</p>

<p>He sighed and walked thoughtfully to the window.
“The past and all its pleasures will soon be but a
dim memory,” he muttered grimly, “as one by one
the connecting links which bound me to it are severed
forever.” He paused and watched her as she joined
her father in the garden, and a quizzical look flashed
across his face. “Faith!” he muttered with a little
smile, “who would believe the time would come when
lovely women would plead in vain for the favors o’
Rob Burns. Och! Robbie, ye are indeed fit only for
the grave,” and he turned away from the window in
earthly meditation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p>The next few days Jean was very busy with her
preparations for their sojourn at the seaside. The
date of their departure was already fixed and it now
lacked but a few days before they would bid farewell
to Ellisland forever, for Robert had decided to
take up his residence in Dumfries when his visit
was ended, for the duties of his new office would necessitate
his being there the quarter part of his time.</p>

<p>As the day of their departure drew near, Robert
grew more and more depressed, and day by day he
sat in melancholy silence beside the window gazing
with unseeing eyes upon the tangled yet graceful
wilderness of flowers. Jean watched him in growing
fear and anxiety as he sank deeper and deeper into
those protracted fits of gloom and depression,
and vainly sought to find some reason for the
sudden change. He had been so elated at getting
his promotion and at the many advantageous
changes it would make in their condition—had dwelt
with affectionate wonder on Eppy’s kindness in
extending to them the invitation to accompany them
to Brow, and had seemed to greatly improve in
health and spirits for a few days. Then came Gilbert’s
letter stating that he had arrived in time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
prevent the eviction of the dear ones at home. The
letter had plunged him into a state of feverish excitement
and restless anxiety, and all day he would sit
at the open window, watching with burning eyes
the long narrow road that twisted and turned on its
way to Mossgiel, straining his eyes eagerly at the
approach of any casual traveler who might be passing,
then with a look of patient despair, sink back
in his chair, pale and listless, his unfocused eyes
again gazing into space. One night after he had
left his chair and had retired to his bed for the night,
looking more haggard than usual, Jean spied on the
floor a crumpled paper which had evidently dropped
from his nerveless hand. Picking it up, she smoothed
it out and found it to be Gilbert’s letter, which she
had not seen, as Robert had read it to her and then
put it carefully aside. Slowly her gaze wandered
over it. Suddenly she gave a great start, for at the
bottom of the page this sentence caught her eye:
“Mary leaves to-morrow for the Highlands and will
pass through Ellisland.” Thoughtfully she put the
letter on the chair where he could find it in the morning,
and sat down by the cradle of the bairn and
gently rocked him till his fretful crying ceased; then
she gave herself up to the heart-burning thoughts
that filled her mind. She had tried so hard to be
patient all these years, she had struggled and struggled
to do her duty without a word of complaint,
she thought, while bitter tears of patient grief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
secret yearning for the love that she knew belonged
to another rolled down her sorrowing cheek. She
had no word of complaint to make against Robert
though, for he had never sought to deceive her
once, and there was no feeling of resentment in
her heart against the little dairymaid. It was not
the child’s fault. It was not the fault of either
that they still loved each other. Only Robert
might have shown her the letter, she thought with
quivering lips; there was no need to keep it from
her. She would know it when Mary came to the house,
anyway. She might have guessed the reason for his
sudden change, she thought, wiping away her tears,
only her mind had been so filled with the household
preparations for moving that Mary had been quite
forgotten. For a while she gently rocked the sleeping
child, watching its sweet, flushed face, listening to
its soft breathing, and soon all disturbing thoughts
slipped away from her troubled mind, and a peaceful,
holy calm entered her patient heart and shone
through her love-lit eyes. Covering its little form
carefully, she carried the cradle into her chamber and
placed it within reach of her bed. Then as she disrobed
for the night in dreary silence, her eyes fixed on
the pale face of her husband, who was tossing and
muttering in his sleep, a tender wave of pity swept
over her at the thought of the sweet lass who would
shortly pass out of their lives forever, leaving only
a sweet, haunting memory behind to remind them of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
her pathetic young life. Quickly she slipped into
bed beside her restless husband, upon whose feverish
cheek she pressed a tender kiss, and closing her tired
eyes, fancied she slept, though her sleep was but a
waking dream of love for her husband and children,
in which all bright hopes and vague longings reached
their utmost fulfillment, and yet were in some strange
way crossed with shadows of sorrow and grief,
which she had no power to disperse.</p>

<p>On the following morning the heat was intense. No
breath of air stirred a ripple on the sluggishly-flowing
Nith, and there was a heaviness in the atmosphere
which made the very brightness of the sky
oppressive. Such hot weather was unusual for that
part of Scotland, and, according to Souter Johnny,
betokened some change. The sun was dazzling, yet
there was a mist in the air as though the heavens were
full of unshed tears. A bank of nearly motionless
clouds hung behind the dark, sharp peaks of the distant
mountains which lay beyond Mossgiel, for there
was no wind stirring, and Robert, seated in his chair
by the window, found himself too warm with his thick
plaid wrapped closely around him, and throwing
it back he let the sunshine bathe him in its golden
glow and play on the uncovered ebony of his hair.
He no longer watched the road with such eager
intensity. Rarely this morning had his gaze wandered
beyond the bush beneath the window, with its
one snowy-white rose, the last rose of summer, nestling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
among the faded, worm-eaten leaves, looking
so pure, so fragrant, so delicately white against the
background of rusty, dead-looking foliage. It had
blossomed in the night, and in the morning when he
had approached the lattice from force of habit, although
he had given up all hope of seeing Mary before
she left Ayrshire, he had spied it in all its delicate
beauty. Each morning for six days now he had
gone to that window, expecting before the day drew
to its close to see the beloved form of his Mary
approach, only to go to his bed at night in bitter
disappointment. Gilbert’s letter stated she would
start that day, and now the sixth day had come and
yet there was no sign of her. He had told himself
he would not watch the road this morning; there was
no use, she had gone; she had not wanted to see him;
she felt too bitter against him—it was only natural
she should. These bitter thoughts had filled his mind
with misery and wretchedness as he drew near the
open window. Suddenly his eyes had rested on the
spot of white nestling on the top of the bush. With
a strange thrill at his heart, he had knelt down beside
the latticed window, and folding his arms on the sill,
gazed at the message from heaven, sent to bring
peace and hope to his aching heart, so he fondly
believed, while bright tears filled his eyes and brimmed
over, falling warmly on his folded hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary, my love, my love!” he whispered
brokenly. “Come to me before ye die.” And all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
that morning he had watched it expand and stretch
out its petals to its utmost, wafting its perfume up
into his grateful nostrils, till a peace such as had
not visited his heart for many years, smoothed out
the lines of suffering from his brow and softened the
hard light in his deepened eyes. A verse of a poem
he had written a few years before flashed across his
memory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oft hae I roved by bonnie Doon,</div>
<div class="verse">To see the rose and woodbine twine;</div>
<div class="verse">And like a bird sang o’ its luve,</div>
<div class="verse">And fondly sae did I o’ mine;</div>
<div class="verse">Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,</div>
<div class="verse">Fu’ sweet upon its thorny tree;</div>
<div class="verse">But my fausse luver stole my rose,</div>
<div class="verse">But ah! he left the thorn wi’ me.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jean, coming into the room a little later, found him
there, his head resting on his hands, a smile of
contented calm upon his face, which now seemed
like the face of the youth she had known in Mauchline,
and the sight thrilled her strangely and brought
a spasm of pain to her overcharged heart.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p>That morning, when Robert first caught sight of the
rose, he had experienced a sort of mental obsession
in which his brain was mastered by the thought—an
absurd idea perhaps, and one which his reason and
his will both might easily have repelled, only he clung
fondly to the belief, letting it fasten itself upon his
mind and grow and grow—that Mary had passed
away in the night, and that her spirit had found a
temporary resting place in the heart of the white
rose that had blossomed forth so unexpectedly, so
unseasonably. He had watched the nodding flower
on its long, slender stem of green, waving gracefully
in the light breeze that had sprung up, and in
his state of dreaming consciousness fancied he could
see the wistful face of Highland Mary peeping out
from among the snowy petals. As the feeling grew
upon him that she had come to him in spirit, a great
content settled down and around him, a mighty calm
that seemed to still the troubled waters of his soul,
and all the bitter discontent, the yearnings of his
heart, the cravings, the unrest, faded away like a
mist dissolved by the warm splendor of the sun. For
a while he had sat there in blissful peace, a smile of
ineffable rapture on his face, gazing with rapt adoring
eyes at the dancing rose, which seductively blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
nearer and nearer to him with each gust of the
swiftly rising wind, then as he would lovingly stretch
out his hand to touch it, to caress it, away it would
go, eluding him like a dancing sunbeam, to the
farthest side of the bush, bending its saucy head
lower and lower till it was lost to sight for an instant,
then up it would bound, gayly nodding, and then for
a moment would pause in its restless elfin dance, quivering
on its stem as though tired with its sportive
play, its coquetry. The sky had grown gradually
darker, and little waves disturbed the smooth surface
of the greenish gray grass that swayed and undulated
in running billows, as the wind rose. But the
kneeling man was all unconscious of the gloom that
had settled over the landscape, shutting out the glorious
sunshine, stilling the song of the birds, and
bringing in its train a damp chill that presaged a
storm. The wind tossed the curls madly about the
face of the poet, but still he did not move; only as
the chill air struck through his thin shirt, he mechanically
pulled his plaid about his shoulders, and
dreamed on happily, of the old days, when the heart
was young, before sorrow had embittered his life,
dreamed of a life of love with Mary by his side,
dreamed and dreamed far into the morning, and so
Jean had found him and left him to his slumbers.
Suddenly his eyes opened, but he did not move.
He sat there feeling a little cramped and stiff, until
hazy recollections dawned slowly upon his mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
then he raised himself from his crouching position,
and leaning out of the window gazed with eyes that
were wonderfully luminous at the blossom which was
just beyond his eager reach. He inhaled deep
breaths of its fragrant perfume, a smile of loving
tenderness on his lips. All at once a feeling of
sudden depression tightened around his heart as he
noticed for the first time the deepening gloom without,
felt the lowering temperature of the atmosphere,
which chilled and depressed him so strangely. He
looked again at the swiftly dancing flower, and his
heart stopped beating for an instant, while a look
of pain, of heart-breaking sorrow, darkened his face—the
white petals were dropping one by one, and
were being whirled and tossed madly through the air
like flakes of snow. He watched in silence, as the
wind, with reckless abandon, tore them out and scattered
them here and there, some sailing merrily out
of sight—one dashing through the open window and
against the white, agonized face of the suffering
man, clinging to it for a moment, in a sweet caress,
a last embrace, then slipping down—down, till it
found rest on the floor, where soon it was dead and
forgotten. As the last snowy petal left its stem,
leaving it looking so bare and pitiful nestling in
among the leaves as though ashamed of its nakedness,
a hard sob of anguish escaped his lips, for it seemed
as if each petal contained a part of the soul of his
loved one, and leaning his face against the sash, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
gave himself up to the crushing sorrow that submerged
his soul and plunged him once more into
black despair. It seemed as if the last link that
had bound her to earth, and to him, was at last
broken and she had passed on out of his life forever;
not even the rose was left to preserve as a sacred
memory to look at occasionally, to bring her presence
nearer. And now no more such roses would
bloom for him, not in this life anyway, and so he
drearily mused in hopeless sorrow.</p>

<p>All at once a vague feeling of uneasiness stole
over him, a curious feeling that he was not alone;
and yet he did not look around, for somehow it seemed
that it was the spirit of his Mary still hovering in the
air, seeking to comfort his grieving heart; and yet
the strange feeling of her nearness was different from
that emotion he had experienced when he in fancy
had looked at her wistful face in the heart of the
nodding rose. And suddenly he held his breath as
the consciousness of her physical presence grew
stronger and stronger upon him; his startled eyes
fixed themselves upon the naked stem, swaying gently
on the bush—he strained his ears to hear—he knew
not what—he could not tell—a trembling seized his
limbs—and when he heard a sweet, low voice call
“Robert,” not from the slender stalk, but somewhere
behind him, he gave no start of surprise. He told
himself it—it—was only imagination—the great
longing within him had—but there it was again—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
could not be fancy—it—it must be—he turned slowly
in the direction of the voice as if afraid to find naught
but the empty room to mock him, for he had heard
no sound to indicate a presence within the room. As
his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom and his dulled
vision cleared, he saw just inside the door, standing
with hands outstretched to him—a flesh and blood
reality, but oh! so pitifully changed. He gave a
gasping cry and sprang to clasp the swaying form
close to his throbbing breast.</p>

<p>Ah! the rapture of that meeting, the blissful joy
which filled his aching heart and crowded out stern
recollections from his memory, while all thoughts of
the grim present, its bitter facts which faced him,
the vain regrets, all—all were now forgotten. The
lines of pain in his haggard face were smoothed out
gently and deep peace settled upon their troubled
souls.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mary!” he breathed softly, breaking the
sacred stillness. “Ye have come at last. Oh, it has
been so long, dearie, so long, and I have wanted ye
so much,” and he held her to his heart in a strong,
jealous, passionate embrace, as if he could never
part with her again on earth, but would shield her
from even the shadow of death, that he saw stamped
on her pale, pinched features, and which glowed in
the haunting depths of her tired blue eyes. A smile
of sadness passed quickly over her face like the sun
that peeps through the sudden rift of a cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye knew, laddie, I couldna’ go awa’ without
seeing ye just once mair,” she whispered tenderly.
A fit of coughing suddenly racked her slender frame.
He led her weak and trembling to a chair and gently
wiped away the beads of perspiration from her forehead,
and for a moment she leaned up against him
in utter exhaustion. Presently she smiled up in his
anxious face and faintly thanked him. “Dinna’ be
alarmed, dearie,” she faltered. “I’m aright noo,”
and she bravely straightened up in her seat, but he
would not release her altogether.</p>

<p>And so they sat, sad and silent, knowing the parting,
the sad, final parting would come in a few
quickly-fleeing moments.</p>

<p>Outside the clouds had been gathering thickly
over the sky, and now and then a few shafts of sunlight
still forced a passage through them with steady
persistency, although storm hovered over all, waiting
the signal to burst forth. Suddenly a silver glare of
lightning sprang out from beneath the black-winged
cloud hanging low in the horizon, and a few large
drops of rain began to fall. Mary nestled closer to
him as she saw the brilliant flash, and shivered apprehensively.
They both were thinking of that other
storm, when he had bidden farewell to Ayrshire in
poverty and despair, to take his place in Edinburgh
among the high and mighty, to claim the reward
of genius—honor, fame and renown. And now the
time had come for her to say farewell, only there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
was a difference, and such a difference! She was bidding
good-by to life, to love, to everything. A
happy smile broke over her wistful face as she
thought of her reward; it would not be such a fleeting
thing as riches, honor and fame. Thank God,
it was more than those; it was an eternity of happiness.
No more sorrow, no more suffering, only
peace, divine peace, such as the world knoweth not,
such as she had never known in her short, eventful
life.</p>

<p>“And so, Mary,” murmured Robert brokenly,
“the end of our life’s romance has come at last.”</p>

<p>She put her little hand in his and pressed it
warmly.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis the end, Robin Adair. The end of all,
but it had to come some time; we were but wearing
our hearts out in vain longings, in bitter regrets,
ye ken that, dear.” She paused and idly watched
the rain, which was now coming down fiercely. “It
will be better for—for us—all when I am gone,”
she murmured presently, with a far-away look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>A sob of anguish caused her to turn quickly to
the sorrowing man by her side. Putting her hand
on his head, she continued in pathetic resignation,
“I will be spared much pain and sorrow, ye ken,
so dinna greet for me, laddie. I—I am content,
nay glad to go, for I—I am so tired—so very
tired of this—long, unhappy struggle.” Her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
trembled and the tears rolled slowly down her sad
cheeks.</p>

<p>“If I, too, could only end it all,” he moaned.</p>

<p>“Sh! laddie!” she answered in gentle reproach.
“Ye mustna’ wish for death; ye have those dependent
on ye, whom ye maun think of noo, Jean and the
bairns.” Her voice grew very sweet and caressing.
“I saw them as I came in. Oh, they are such bonnie
little lads, dearie. So like ye, too. Gilbert is o’er
fond of them; he is playing wi’ them noo.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop had been taken ill at the last moment
and had commissioned Gilbert to take her place. She
had supplied him plentifully with money for the
journey and had then sorrowfully taken her departure
for Edinburgh, her kind old heart sad and heavy.</p>

<p>“Robbie lad,” continued Mary earnestly, “ye—ye
maun take Jean close to your heart. Ye maun
love her fondly for the bairns’ sake and—for her
own, too, for she is a good, kind wife to ye, and ye’ll
all—be very happy yet, I ken weel.”</p>

<p>He slipped down from his chair to his knees and
buried his tear-stained face in her lap. “When ye
go, Mary,” he murmured brokenly, “I’ll never know
peace and happiness again.” She let him weep on
in silence. Presently he raised his head and looked
at her. “Ye dinna’ ken, lassie, how I have hungered
for a sight of your dear face—a word from your
sweet lips, this last year.” He clung to her passionately.
“An’ noo in a few minutes,” he continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
in anguish, “ye will pass out o’ my life forever and
I maun live on here—desolate—and heart-broken.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” she cried reproachfully. “Dinna’
say that, laddie, not alone, not alone,” and she looked
compassionately at the door of the kitchen where
Jean sat in patient misery holding her bairn to her
aching heart. At that moment Gilbert softly opened
the door and told them that they would have to
start at once, that the storm would not let up and
that they must catch the boat at Greenock that
night.</p>

<p>“Ye had better say good-by, noo,” and he closed
the door quietly behind him.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, too dazed for words.
Then she started to rise to her feet, but he clasped
her hands tightly, though she did not feel the pain,
and pressed her into the seat again.</p>

<p>“Not yet, not yet, Mary!” he gasped. “I
canna’ let ye go just yet. ’Tis like tearing my heart
out by its roots.”</p>

<p>“Ye mustna’ greet so, laddie,” said Mary, frightened
by the vehemence of his sorrow.</p>

<p>“’Tis all my fault,” he moaned, “all thro’ my
sinful weakness that ye are made to suffer noo, all
my fault.”</p>

<p>She put her fingers on his lips. “Sh! dearie!”
she remonstrated softly. “Dinna’ blame yoursel’.
If we suffer noo, we must na’ forget how happy we
have been, and we were happy, weren’t we, laddie?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and she smiled in fond reminiscence, then continued
a trifle unsteadily, “An—an hour’s happiness
is worth a year of pain, for when we get sad
an’ lonely, we can live it all over again, canna’ we?”
She paused and sighed pathetically. “Only it—it
isna’ real, is it, laddie?” A sudden break in her
voice caused her to put her hand to her throat and
look away with quivering lips. Then she went on
in plaintive, pleading gentleness, “Ye will sometimes
think of me—way up—in the Highlands, won’t ye,
dearie? It willna’ wrong—Jean, for—soon your
Mary will be—in Heaven, in her castle grand.”</p>

<p>The thunder rolled along the sky in angry reverberating
echoes, stilling the low voice, while frequent
flashes of lightning leaped out like knives suddenly
drawn from dark sheaths—yet toward the north
over Greenock the sky was clearing, and streaks
and beams of gold fell from the hidden sun, with a
soothing promise of a clear and radiant sunset.
Mary’s face brightened as she watched the sunbeams
struggling through the lightened clouds, and
she went on dreamily, in the prolonged lull of the
storm:</p>

<p>“My home there will be so fine, much finer than
the castle in Edinburgh.” She smiled tenderly and
let her hand slip down from his head to his heaving
shoulder, where it rested in loving quiet. “How
happy I was that night,” she mused; “an’ the sweet
gown was so pretty I—hated to take it off, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
wasna’ mine.” She paused with quivering lips. “But—but—I
was going to buy one the next day for
my own, wasna’ I? A white one—all smooth and
soft and shiny—for—for my wedding gown.” Her
voice died away in a hushed, mournful quaver.</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, Mary!” sobbed Robert unrestrainedly.
“I canna’ bear to think of that noo, noo
when I maun give ye up forever.” He stroked her
face and covered her pale, thin, toil-worn hands
with heart-breaking kisses. Presently he grew
calmer. “I shall never forget that night, Mary,
that night with its pleasures and pain,” he went on
with dreamy pathos. “It is ever in my thoughts;
e’en in my dreams your dear bonnie face haunts
me with its sweet, pathetic smile, and your tender lips
seem to say, ‘laddie, ye were not true to your vows,
ye have broken my heart.’” She gave a little cry
of pain.</p>

<p>“No, no, laddie, I never thought that,” she cried,
and she looked at him with gentle, pitying eyes.</p>

<p>“I wad try to speak, to implore your forgiveness
for the misery I had caused ye,” continued Robert,
his husky voice heard faintly above the wail of the
wind, which shook the lattice with a sort of stealthy
clatter, like a midnight prowler striving to creep in
to steal and plunder. “And in my dumb despair
and anguish I would clutch at your floating garments
only to have them vanish into air, and I would
awake to find myself—alone—with my bitter remorse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and sorrow.” A low, choked sob broke from
his hollow breast—he covered his face with his hands.
“Can ye ever forgive me?” he murmured.</p>

<p>Mary regarded him with infinite compassion, a
heroic smile on her tired, quivering lips. “Freely
do I forgive everything, laddie,” she replied, “an’
when I am gone I want ye to remember always that
Mary Campbell had only love, pity and forgiveness
in her heart for ye.” She raised her trembling
hands solemnly. “May God bring peace to your
troubled heart, laddie, and may your future dreams
be filled with joy and happiness, of love and prosperity.”</p>

<p class="caption">“The door opened and Jean quietly entered the room.”</p>
</div>

<p>The door opened and Jean quietly entered the
room, her tense, white face full of patient sorrow.
She had sat in the kitchen for an eternity it seemed
to the waiting woman, while Mary was taking her
farewell of her husband. She had tried to talk to
Gilbert, to interest herself in the news of home, but
the words simply refused to leave her lips, and so
she had sat there, listlessly watching the children
playing around their uncle’s knee, her ears straining
to hear some sound from the other room. No one
knew how she suffered, to step aside, to welcome to
her home his former sweetheart, to know they were
there clasped in each other’s arms; and yet she did
not feel bitter toward Mary somehow, strange as it
might seem. She pitied her, she pitied them both,
and it filled her with a strange feeling of surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
that she could feel so. Still loving Robert as fondly
as she did, she could not help the feeling of despair
which crept over her at times, to know, to fully realize,
that she held only a secondary place in his
affections, to hear him calling for another, for
Mary. Sometimes in thought she caught herself
bitterly arraigning him for his thoughtlessness, his
apparent heartlessness; then the thought of his weak
condition, his ill health, his distracted state of mind,
these past months, tempered her judgment. He was
hardly responsible for his actions, and if he were
conscious of his own selfishness he had lost the power,
the strength of will, to restrain his feverish impulses.
She wondered vaguely if it would be different when—when
she had passed away forever—if her memory
would still come between them. She hoped not—she
prayed that it might not be so.</p>

<p>Gilbert had left her to her silent musings, and had
gone out to harness the horses. Returning, he told
her that they must start at once, so she had opened
the door to tell them, and as her eyes took in the
misery which was reflected in their white, drawn faces
she was moved to intense pity, and the tears rained
slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Come, Mary, Gilbert says ’tis time to start,”
she faltered. They both looked up slowly at the
sound of her voice, then gazed dully into each other’s
eyes. Presently Mary rose from her chair and stood
up unsteadily, stretching out her little, cold, white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
hands to Robert, who clutched them in his own feverish
palms as a drowning man clutches a straw.</p>

<p>“The time has come to part, laddie,” she said
bravely, a wan little smile on her bluish lips.</p>

<p>A violent shuddering seized him, he did not move
for a moment. Finally he staggered to his feet,
and a quiver of agony passed over his face. He
looked at her with dulled, glazed eyes and his face
assumed a ghastly hue.</p>

<p>“’Tis so hard, so cruel, to say good-by forever,”
he breathed huskily, for his throat was dry and
parched. His swaying figure tottered a moment,
then he drew her slowly into his arms and pressed
his lips to her forehead. “’Tis the last time on
earth, Mary,” he whispered brokenly. Her lips
trembled, but she would not give way to the feeling of
dizziness that threatened to rob her of her consciousness.
She must leave him with a smile, she
told herself; she must not make it harder for him.
“Yes, for the last time, Robert,” she repeated slowly.
“May God bless and watch over ye, Robin Adair—till—we—meet
in Heaven. Good-by.” Her voice
died away inarticulately, and she sank forward into
his arms, where she lay motionless with closed eyes,
utterly spent in body and spirit, and save for a
shivering sob that now and then escaped her, she
seemed almost insensible. Jean rushed quickly forward
and drew her into a chair, while Gilbert fetched
a glass of water, which he held to her white lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind shook the doors and whistled shrilly
through the crevices, then as though tired of its own
wrath, surged away in hoarse murmurs, through
the branches of the creaking old beech, toward the
Loch, and there was a short, tense silence while they
waited to see signs of life appear in the face of the
stricken girl. Presently she opened those azure blue
eyes and smiled up in their anxious faces; then she
struggled to her feet, but she put her hand quickly
to her heart and tottered.</p>

<p>“Oh, my—poor—weak heart,” she gasped faintly.
Jean caught her quickly in her strong arms and
stroked her soft cheek with a curious yearning sensation
of love tugging at her heartstrings.</p>

<p>“Poor dear,” she said compassionately, “you’re
too weak to stand so much excitement,” and she put
her back firmly in the chair. Mary attempted to
rise again, but Jean would not permit her. “Gilbert
shall carry you to the carriage,” she told her.
Gilbert stepped to her side.</p>

<p>“I will be a light burden noo, Gilbert,” she faltered,
smiling pathetically into his strong, rugged
face, which bore traces of his deep, bitter grief.
Jean gently put her arms about her and in silence
implanted a kiss on her pure, sweet face; then she
turned away and covered her face with her hands.
Gilbert bent over and picked up the frail body, and
in spite of his efforts to restrain his emotion, a sigh
that was almost a groan escaped him, for she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
no heavier than a child of a few summers. He carried
her past his brother, who was sitting with head
bowed upon his breast in an attitude of absolute
despair.</p>

<p>“Greet not for me, dearie,” whispered Mary
faintly, stretching out her hand and letting it rest
tenderly on his head. “God’s—will—be—done,”
and her dry, burning eyes took their last look, and
said their last farewell as Gilbert slowly carried her
from the room and closed the door, shutting Robert
out from her lingering gaze.</p>

</div>

<p>For some moments Robert sat there, apparently
dead to his surroundings. He had not looked up or
moved as the door closed upon the retreating figures.
He seemed to be in a state of complete exhaustion
of mind and body. Presently the sound of the carriage
rolling over the swishing, muddy driveway
roused him from his lethargy. Raising his head he
looked wildly around the room—then paused and
listened—he was as one in a dream, realizing nothing
plainly. He could hardly remember what had taken
place during the past few minutes; he could grasp
nothing tangible in thought or memory, till with a
wild start he seemed to awake, as the rattle of the
passing wheels brought back recollection. He staggered
to the window and, throwing back the lattice,
gazed out at the rapidly retreating blur of moving
wheels and horses and shapeless figures, and watched
it till it was lost to sight. As he stood there a soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
change, a delicate transparency, swept over the dark
bosom of the sky. Pale pink streaks glittered on the
dusky horizon—darts of light began to climb upward
into the clouds, and to plunge downward upon the
waving field of hay; the radiance spread swiftly, till
suddenly the whole heavens were bathed in the glorious
light, and the last cloud, fading into nothingness,
revealed the sun in all its matchless glory, hanging
low in the sky just above the hills, behind which it
would soon drop in stately splendor. Slowly the
watcher sank down to his knees and leaned his tired
head against the sash, his eyes closed and sunken.</p>

<p>“She is gone, gone,” he murmured brokenly, “an’
I am left all alone noo, all alone.” Jean bent over
him with pathetic tenderness, and taking his limp
hand in her own warm palm, she said with timid
reproach:</p>

<p>“Not alone, Robert, while you have your—bairns—and
me.” She feared to call his attention
to herself in the midst of his grief, lest he might
revile her for standing between him and happiness;
but he did not hear.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jean, how can I take up the burden of life
again?” he cried weakly, clinging to her hand with
despairing strength. It thrilled her strangely to
feel the grasp of his hand, to feel his weakness, his
sudden dependence, the appeal in his dark, mournful
eyes raised to hers so pitifully; she knelt beside him
and drew his head down on her heaving bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye must be brave,” she told him, her voice trembling
with a new-found happiness, a sudden joy. He
needed her now, needed her love and care more than
ever. Then she continued softly, her voice vibrating
with thrilling intensity, “Ye have much to live
for yet, lad. Ye must be strong, ye must be brave.
Pluck up your courage! I’ll help ye.”</p>

<p>He looked at her wonderingly, then he slowly
bowed his head. “Yes, Jean,” he said humbly, “I
will be strong; I’ll try to be brave.”</p>

<p>She helped him to his chamber, and placed him
beside the window, where he could no longer watch
the road, and left him. For a while he gazed out
over the fields in apathetic calm, his mind a blank.
Across the field he could see Souter Johnny at work
in his garden. Suddenly he straightened up and
listened. Souter was singing.</p>

wearily, but he could not shut out the sound.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary, my lost Highland Mary,” he whispered
under his breath.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>by</i> FRANK W. HASTINGS<br />
<span class="smaller">AUTHOR OF SEVERAL WIDELY UNKNOWN WORKS</span></p>

<p>The book is a series of deliciously funny essays on such
things as Marriage, Work, Love, Country, Church, Wrecks,
Politics, Sundries, etc.</p>

<p>The book bears this unique dedication, “To the everlasting,
ever present, ever dignified, ever-plentiful and never
murmuring weather these evidences of dementia are inscribed.”</p>

<p>It is quite the funniest book of philosophy ever published
and one of the best works of humor that have been issued in
many years.</p>
